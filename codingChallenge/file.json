{"a": "In what appears to be a move away from fast fashion, PrettyLittleThing have launched an app which will allow customers to re-sell their old clothes. Earlier this week, the fashion giant announced Indiyah Polack - one of this year's Love Island finalists - as the first PLT Marketplace ambassador. . The 23-year-old will be selling some of her own outfits on the site, and in a statement said the app's focus on re-wearing and re-selling was \"something that's important to [her]\". . Some have seen it as a positive move from the brand, which might encourage more young people to shop second hand. . But there has been a backlash, and many have accused PLT of \"greenwashing\" - marketing designed to make customers believe your company is doing more to protect the environment than it really is. Brett Staniland, who was on Love Island last year, agrees. . Even before his time on the show, the 28-year-old model has taken a stance against fast fashion. While on the series, he refused to wear clothes from the show's then sponsor, I Saw It First. Last year, he protested outside a PrettyLittleThing catwalk show put on by the brand's creative director and fellow former Islander Molly-Mae Hague. . Brett tells Radio 1 Newsbeat that he thinks PLT are putting the onus on consumers to be more environmentally friendly. . \"When I saw the announcement, it was a massive eye roll,\" he says. \"It was interesting for me to see PLT announcing that this is how they're going to be more ethically responsible. . \"But they were essentially just placing all the responsibility on the consumers.\". Rona\u00e9 Fagon, a 30-year-old fashion consultant, says the app doesn't do anything to tackle wider issues within the industry, such as working conditions - something PLT's parent company Boohoo . has faced criticism over. . \"Unless they go deeper and deal with the actual issue of their overproduction, heavy use of oil-derived materials, exploitation of workers in their supply chains and quality of their garments, it's not even scratching the surface,\" she says. . But, despite its critics, the site - which isn't just limited to PLT clothes - might encourage some shoppers to think about making more sustainable fashion choices. . TikTok influencer Victoria Wright, 26, says it's a \"step in the right direction\".  . \"Having someone like Indiyah champion it is great, because she's got an amazing fashion sense,\" she says. . \"It'll encourage young people to get online and buy second hand, rather than go out and buy new.\". PrettyLittleThing said in a statement: \"Our customers told us they want simple and easy ways to give their old clothes a new lease of life and make some money for themselves in the process. . \"PrettyLittleThing Marketplace is a community platform that will allow people to do just that. . \"We are all about making fashion more diverse and inclusive, giving our customers the creative freedom to express themselves. . \"With the PLT Marketplace App, it is now even easier to join our'PLTLoved movement as we all play our part in reducing waste.\".

{"a": "Queen Elizabeth II has been laid to rest at Windsor Castle after a state funeral took place at Westminster Abbey. It marked the final day of a period of national mourning since the Queen's death. The Queen's . state funeral was held at Westminster Abbey.  in London, the historic church where Britain's kings and queens are crowned. A two-minute national silence was held at its end. The Queen's coffin then travelled in a procession to Wellington Arch, at London's Hyde Park Corner, before being taken to Windsor Castle in the State Hearse. After a procession up the castle's Long Walk, a committal service, with a smaller congregation, took place at St George's Chapel. The Queen was buried later at a private family service. At the end of the committal service at Windsor Castle, the Queen's coffin was lowered into the Royal Vault. Later, it was interred at the King George VI memorial chapel, inside St George's Chapel. The Queen was buried together with her late husband, the Duke of Edinburgh. Windsor Castle is in the town of Windsor, about 20 miles west of central London. The castle, which is an official royal residence, has been home to monarchs for almost 1,000 years. . It had special significance to the Queen throughout her life. As a teenager she was sent there during the war years as London faced the threat of bombing. More recently, she made it her permanent home during the coronavirus pandemic. St George's Chapel, within the walls of Windsor Castle, is the church regularly chosen by the Royal Family for weddings, christenings and funerals. . It is where the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, . Prince Harry and Meghan, were married in 2018.  and where the . Queen's late husband Prince Philip's funeral.  was held. Buckingham Palace released the order of service for the funeral, which includes details of all the music and the readings. The order of service for St George's Chapel, Windsor, was also published. About 2,000 guests attended the funeral at Westminster Abbey. Among the members of the Royal Family who were there were Prince George (9) and Princess Charlotte (7), the oldest children of the Prince and Princess of Wales. Joining them were about 500 leaders and dignitaries from the UK and around the world. The guests at the smaller committal service were largely made up of current and former staff from the Queen's household and private estates. A state funeral is typically held for a king or queen and follows strict rules of protocol. . A military procession carries the coffin to Westminster Hall, and is followed by a . period of lying-in-state, and a service at Westminster Abbey or St Paul's Cathedral. . . In rare cases, a state funeral can also be held for \"other exceptionally distinguished persons\". These have included Sir Isaac Newton, Lord Nelson, the Duke of Wellington and Lord Palmerston. Buckingham Palace said that only working members of the Royal Family who hold military rank would wear uniform at the five ceremonial events marking the Queen's death, including the funeral. Prince Andrew and the Duke of Sussex did not wear uniform to most events, although an exception was made for the vigils held in Westminster Hall. Monday was a bank holiday, and many shops and businesses . were closed. , as were schools. GP surgeries were told . they could close. , some dentists did not see patients and some hospitals cancelled routine appointments. Some . extra trains were added.  for people travelling to and from London. . No date has been set so far for the coronation, which is when King Charles is formally crowned. The ceremony is unlikely to take place immediately, because of the planning required. Queen Elizabeth succeeded to the throne in February 1952, but was not crowned until June 1953."},

{"a": "Believed to have started in 869AD, the Gion Matsuri is one of the most famous annual festivals in Japan. This year it embraced the digital world. For the 2022 event back in July, an interactive, online map was made available to show where and when to see the 34 huge, ornate floats that paraded across the city of Kyoto over two separate days. Using GPS, it showed the location of each float. And you could also use the map to find your friends and chat with them. In addition, if you clicked on a building or street, you could read about its history in Japanese or English. The person behind the technology is Machi Takahashi, the president and co-chief executive of Kyoto-based, digital map firm Stroly. A mother of two, she is a rare female entrepreneur in a country where the start-up scene is still very much dominated by men. \"I was surprised that [the festival organisers] would let us digitise their map, because I thought these traditional cultural festivals are quite conservative,\" she says. The website-based digital map is accessed by scanning a QR code. Hideo Yoshii, who is in charge of looking after one of the biggest floats, says that Stroly may have gotten some pushback if it had just wanted to put QR code stickers or signs up on walls. Instead Stroly created a pretty postcard that had not just the QR code printed on it, but also the pattern of a traditional Japanese map. This complemented the atmosphere of the ancient event, and was also used as the design for the digital map Stroly made. \"Before the pandemic, we gave out a pamphlet, but tourists found it difficult to navigate the city,\" says a spokeswoman for the city's tourism department. \"By using Stroly's digital map, police officers who are on the ground found it much easier to explain to visitors where to go. We've also managed to reduce our paper waste by a third,\" she adds. . The idea to set up a business making digital maps came to Ms Takahashi and her husband and co-founder Toru while they were both still working at Kyoto-based technology research institute ATR. He is Stroly's chairman and co-chief executive. . One of their first customers was the movie industry theme park Toei Kyoto Studio Park back in 2010. \"We asked Mr and Ms Takahashi to create a game using Nintendo DS,\" says Norihiro Yamaguchi, who was the boss of Toei Kyoto Studio Park at the time. New Tech Economy.  is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape. The map and GPS-based game that the Takahashis produced involved the park's visitors having to locate seven actors playing screen villains. Six years later, the Takahashis left the research institute to set up Stroly as their own business, with the theme park remaining one of its main clients. . \"Thanks to smartphones which allow users to access the Stroly map in different languages, visitors can find out about the details of our shows and facilities,\" says a spokesman for the park. Stroly has now produced almost 10,000 interactive, digital maps, including one highlighting the vibrant nightlife of the busy Shinjuku area of central Tokyo. That was commissioned by the government of the capital city. Other maps include where to find the best cheese in the Tokachi dairy farming region of Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost main island, as well as work for clients outside Japan. For members of the public Stroly's maps are free to use. It instead makes its money by charging its customers, mostly in tourism and transport, annual subscriptions. \"When I started thinking about starting my own business in 2015, there was no woman in this information technology field so I had to find my way into this community,\" says Ms Takahashi. \"I had to actually contact [US-based Japanese entrepreneur] Ari Horie from Women's Startup Lab in Silicon Valley, instead of [anyone] in Japan, to help me out.\". Stroly was subsequently selected as one of the first start-ups to be given mentoring by a new regional business support agency called Osaka Innovation Hub. This was where Ms Takahashi managed to secure funding from Japanese investment bank Daiwa Securities. The firm also later received money from Kyoto City's start-up fund. The difficulty faced by female entrepreneurs is not unique to Japan. Even in the US, . only 2% of venture capital, which invests in new start-ups, went to women last year. In an . article for Vogue magazine.  last month where she announced that she was \"evolving away from tennis\", US sports star Serena Williams said this was part of the reason she launched her own investment fund, Serena Ventures. \"Sometimes like attracts like,\" wrote Williams. \"Men are writing those big cheques to one another, and in order for us to change that, more people who look like me need to be in that position, giving money back to themselves.\". Ms Takahashi agrees. \"The decision-making roles are also mostly [held by] men. I think they simply cannot relate to the problems and issues addressed by women entrepreneurs,\" she says. The Japanese government had wanted to use the five years from 2015 to 2020 . to almost triple the proportion of female managers in the country to reach 30% of the total.  However, the current level is just 15%, compared with . the global average of 31%. . And according to the country's Financial Services Agency, . less than 1% of Japanese venture capital firms are run by women. Kathy Matsui leads one such firm, MPower Partners, which she recently started in Tokyo with two female partners, Yumiko Murakami and Seki Miwa. A former vice chair of investment bank Goldman Sachs Japan, Ms Matsui is best known for her \"womenomics\" drive since the 1990s, which has encouraged the Japanese government . to improve its gender ratio among businesses. . . \"I would say the vast majority of entrepreneurs and founders we've met so far, here in Japan, are male,\" she says. \"But when we think about start-ups, they're trying to use innovation to create disruptive businesses, life-changing technologies. And if you're excluding half the population from your potential talent pool as a start-up, you're already trying to win a marathon on one leg rather than two.\". Back in Kyoto, Ms Takahashi's success in finding a gap in the digital tourism market may be an exception to the male-dominated rule. There is no denying that it is still an uphill battle to create a greater equal footing in Japan's workforce. So does she have any advice for younger entrepreneurs, and particularly female ones? . \"Jump into the ecosystem,\" she says. \"It is very easy to get to know someone in the field, and once you know somebody, it's a great network that you need to expand your business.\".

{"a": "When Michelle Ruiz's mum was diagnosed with pre-diabetes in 2020, the Chicago-based chemical engineer set out to improve not just her own family's health but everyone's. . \"Foods containing refined carbs [like white flour] are leading drivers of chronic illnesses, including diabetes and heart disease,\" says Ms Ruiz. But flour, she says, is culturally ingrained in our lives. \"I wanted to help people enjoy food culture - and still live long and healthy lives.\". In 2021, she co-founded Hyf\u00e9 Foods. Hyf\u00e9 uses the root network of mushrooms, called mycelium, to make an alternative to wheat flour. \"In addition to the neutral taste, mycelium is high-protein, high-fibre, gluten-free and low carb,\" says Ms Ruiz. Producing mycelium, however, is water-intensive and expensive because of the sugars needed to feed the fungi. . To address this, Hyf\u00e9 uses waste sugar water from food manufacturing. \"Our goal is to scale our technology so that we can achieve price parity, which is why we use upcycled sugar water,\" says Ms Ruiz. \"Up to half of the cost of fermentation can be attributed to sugar, so upcycling can make a meaningful difference to the cost of production.\". Affordable alternatives to wheat are gaining attention, particularly after a year of disruption to the grain market. The war in Ukraine has highlighted our dependence on the wheat harvests that flow from the region.  . Russia and Ukraine together account for nearly a third of global wheat supplies. The war has disrupted that flow of food. In July this year, wheat prices were almost 25% higher than in July 2021. Record high food prices have triggered a global hunger crisis of unprecedented proportions. According to the World Food Programme, the number of people facing acute food insecurity has more than doubled in just two years, from 135 million in 53 countries to 345 million in 82 countries today. On top of that, we are starting to see the impact of climate change. Crops are suffering under the effects of extreme weather. A 2021 report from Chatham House warns that unless we drastically reduce global emissions, by 2050 staple crop yields could decline by nearly a third. . Harvard University scientists say even if we do manage to limit global warming to 2C, as set out by the Paris Agreement, 60% of the world's wheat production will be under threat by the end of the century. \"Even before Ukraine, we had a broken system,\" says Shailaja Fennell, development economist at Cambridge University and founding member of the Forgotten Crops Society. \"While we produced more than enough food, the cost of that food to the environment is already a major concern.\". Prof Fennell warns that monoculture farming - growing one crop species in a field at a time - is not sustainable. . \"[Monoculture crops] are much more susceptible to climate shocks, diseases and drought. Having a more diversified agriculture is the way forward.\". To combat food insecurity some countries, including China and Egypt, are ramping up domestic wheat production. Wheat is even being planted in the Egyptian desert. Instead of trying to grow more wheat, Prof Fennell suggests we look to other cereals, ones that have been forgotten by the global supply chain. . \"There is a whole group of cereals called millets - small-seeded grasses similar to oats and barley - that are more hardy, use less water and are gluten-free,\" she says. . Such alternatives, says Prof Fennell, can have nutritional benefits over wheat and would be of huge interest to the pasta industry. More technology of business:. Pasta is a staple food for millions of people worldwide. It is easy to store when dried, simple to prepare and economical. . According to the International Pasta Organisation almost 17 million tonnes of pasta was produced in 2021 - more than double the amount produced 20 years ago. Durum wheat, from which pasta is typically made, is high yielding and provides about 20% of all calories consumed by humans. In fact, about two-thirds of our daily calories come from just three crops - wheat, rice and maize. . By 2050, the global population is predicted to rise to nearly 10 billion, putting extreme strain on our planet's resources. So since there are about 50,000 edible plant species, perhaps it is time to explore our options. In London's Covent Garden families, friends and lovers dine on pasta under dimmed lights, while Italian classical music plays in the background. But this is not a standard Italian restaurant, and it does not just sell standard pasta. In 2017, Alberto Cartasegna opened his first restaurant, Miscusi, in Milan. He wanted to offer authentic Italian pasta, while having a positive impact on the planet. Five years later and Miscusi now has 15 restaurants in Italy and two in the UK, and has launched its \"M7 pasta\" - a blend of four grains and three legumes - in a bid to promote biodiversity. \"Biodiversity is killed when we approach agriculture with conventional methods like monocropping,\" says Mr Cartasegna. . \"M7 is made of seven different types of grains and legumes, giving our pasta a unique flavour, texture and colour. It's rich in plant-based proteins thanks to the three legumes. All the cereals are organic and wholegrain, keeping fibres and micronutrients to the max. . \"I strongly believe we must change the global diet to save ourselves.\". Los Angeles mother-of-two Gail Becker has also been promoting wheat alternatives. She became frustrated when she could not find healthy alternatives for her sons, who both suffer from coeliac disease, an autoimmune disorder triggered by eating foods containing gluten. \"I tried desperately to find nutritious, gluten-free options that weren't filled with fat, sugar, salt and calories,\" says Ms Becker. \"I stumbled upon recipes for cauliflower crust pizza. . \"My creation tasted fine, but it looked awful, my kitchen was a disaster and I had spent 90 minutes I didn't have, as a mum with a full-time job, making a pizza crust! I realised I probably wasn't alone. So I left my job to strike out on my own and create Caulipower.\". Caulipower, established in 2016, has since expanded beyond pizza crusts to offer frozen cauliflower pastas. Its products can now be found in more than 25,000 stores across the US. \"Consumers want nutritional food,\" says Ms Becker. \"They no longer expect to have to choose between taste and health, and frankly they shouldn't have to.\". Back in Chicago, Hyf\u00e9 is busy cultivating mycelium and turning it into carbon-neutral, healthy, affordable pasta. \"We're creating a new staple crop,\" says Ms Ruiz. \"One that can be grown nearly anywhere in the world, giving countries increased food sovereignty, and employing circular technology for a more resilient food system. \"Our pasta is not just better for you, it's better for the planet.\"."},

{"a": "In the summer heat, few things are more satisfying than a cooling ice cream. But did you ever wonder what it takes to make the scoop on your cone?  . This traditional treat dates back centuries, but today many frozen desserts are the culmination of months of research and development. On the outskirts of the Danish city Aarhus is what might be considered ice cream's answer to Silicon Valley. . Among a cluster of businesses, including dairy producers, engineers and service providers, is a manufacturing plant owned by food packaging giant Tetra Pak. . This place is also home to a product development centre where future recipes and technology are tested out. . \"It's the first step in a long journey to having a product launched,\" says Elsebeth Baungaard, portfolio manager at Tetra Pak. \"We're testing what we will see on the market next summer or two years from now.\" . Inside the bright laboratory are steel vats, freezers and a machine turning out oval-shaped ice creams onto a conveyor belt.  . Tetra Pak's clients - the world's major ice cream brands - often spend two or three days in the facility making and tasting samples. . \"We see how the mouthfeel is, the texture, and if it's working,\" she explains. . There are also a variety of experts at hand to help out with the process along the way, including specialist \"stick inserters\". . The facility allows customers to try new recipes without tying up their own production. New products are released in late spring, then manufacturing ramps up ready for summer. \"There's a lot of investment in innovation during the winter,\" says Tetra Pak's Ice Cream Academy manager Torben Vilsgaard. . The US and China are the biggest consumers, and according to Tetra Pak, more than 25 billion litres were eaten worldwide in 2021.  . Meanwhile in the UK, sizzling summer temperatures have sent ice cream sales soaring. Data from NielsenIQ shows purchases were 28% higher in the four weeks to mid-August, compared a year earlier. . But just how is this delicious treat made? . Production starts with the mix. Milk or water is combined with dry ingredients such as milk solids, sugars and dairy or vegetable fats. The liquid is heated and homogenised, then cooled and \"aged\". Dressed in a white lab coat, Mr Vilsgaard walks me through the process. \"We add functional ingredients like flavours and colours, but also stabilisers and the emulsifier. \"They give some viscosity. That is the mouthfeel, when it's consumed and melting down.\" . Next it's pumped to a continuous freezer. \"This is the heart of any ice cream production facility,\" he says. This \"small\" unit can make 700 litres an hour, but commercial-scale freezers can produce up to 4,000. . Inside a rotating cylinder the mix is rapidly cooled and beaten, while incorporating air. The ice cream emerges slightly soft, so it can be pumped into a tub or mould, then stored at a lower temperature.  . While the recipe sounds simple, ice cream has a complex chemistry consisting of ice crystals, air bubbles and fat globules, held in a water and sugar solution. . \"It's one of the few products that holds all three states at once. It's solid, liquid and gas, all in one,\" says Dr Chika Nweke, a fellow in biochemical engineering, who teaches ice cream manufacturing at University College London. . \"Normally liquids and oils don't mix very well. But with the addition of the emulsifier you get the fats in the ice cream sticking together with the liquids,\" she says. . Getting the balance right is a precise science and it's important for the ice cream's stability. Recipes have really evolved, says Dr Nweke, and there is a lot of research going into new ingredients, particularly alternatives to lactose or sugars. . However, there are also some rather more unexpected components. \"Up to 50% of it can be air,\" says Dr Nweke, revealing that it's crucial to making the ice cream \"scoop-able\". . More technology of business:. Commercial production is increasingly automated and at Tetra Pak engineers are tinkering with a new factory line capable of making a million ice creams a day.  . The firm estimates that half of the world's ice cream output is made using its equipment. . Recently it supplied one of the first collaborative robots, known as a cobot, where staff work alongside it filling ice cream bowls. . Designers are also developing special nozzles to make complex shapes like animals, or multiple layers of different flavours, and moulds are 3D printed. . However, keeping ice cream cold is energy-intensive. Elsebeth Baungaard says she and her colleagues are working on a more targeted cooling process that chills specific spots. . Other firms have developed technology that is quite literally \"out of the box\". For example, US firm Cold Snap makes ice cream pods that are only frozen in an appliance when you want to eat it, thereby eliminating the energy consumed by storing it in a freezer. . Back in the lab at Tetra Pak, where future ice creams are tested, I'm keen to get the inside scoop on what's coming next. . \"I'm sorry to say it's simply shrinking. We are downsizing the volume,\" Ms Baungaard replies. \"Small cones, small sticks, the bite-size. But the quality will be higher.\". That's a global trend that Kate Vlietstra, a food and drink analyst from Mintel, also recognises, together with a shift towards more \"indulgent\" flavours over healthier, low-calorie choices. \"People go for affordable treats,\" she says. The firm's research found that 48% of UK consumers think it has been \"easier to justify eating indulgent food or drink since Covid-19\". Ms Vlietstra thinks concerns about the cost-of-living crisis will have a similar impact. \"Ice cream is obviously very affordable, even a premium ice cream, and can offer a great experience at home.\". But while both younger and older consumers buy ice cream regularly, she says it is millennial consumers who are driving interest in more original flavours, including spices like chilli or cardamom. Dairy still dominates, but plant-based ice cream and sorbets are another growing segment. Other new innovations may soon find their way into our freezers. Behind Ms Baungaard is a machine with a wheel that can embed chunks of cookie dough or brownie, known as inclusions, into ice creams on a stick. . \"That's new,\" she says. \"We are the only one on the market who can do it.\" (It is already done in cups.). Another new technique is decorating stick products with patterns or writing. As ice cream samples pass by, you have to wonder if this line of work might be potentially hazardous for dessert lovers. . \"It is absolute temptation,\" Ms Baungaard says. \"But you also get used to it.\"."},

{"a": "As the COP26 climate summit enters its second week, negotiations in Glasgow have hit a critical phase. . The conference is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. So we asked more than a dozen climate scientists, negotiators and economists from around the world what they wanted to see agreed this week. The scientists all wanted to see more countries commit to net zero by 2050 at the latest. Yet many said changes in the next decade would be the most impactful. Governments must agree to \"cut emissions by half in the next 10 years\", says Prof Mark Maslin, who researches the impact of humans on the environment at University College London. The Paris climate agreement in 2015 committed countries to reach net zero between 2050 and 2100. But reaching net zero is not easy and means big changes to transport, manufacturing, food supplies, construction and almost every aspect of life. . And many of the scientists think 2050 might be too late, particularly if countries don't cut emissions drastically before then. . \"The longer you leave it, the more difficult it is to deliver net zero by 2050,\" says Prof Martin Siegert, who researches changes in glaciers at Imperial College London. . More than 100 countries have made the 2050 commitment, yet dozens have not. Others big emitters, . such as China.  and . Saudi Arabia. , have made a net zero commitment - but by 2060, not 2050. . One of the world's largest emitters, India. , says it will get to net zero by 2070 - 20 years later. The scientists said countries must sign up to go quicker. \"We've got to get international consensus at least in principle around the notion of net zero by 2050,\" says Prof Siegert. \"If that can be done at least in principle at Glasgow, it will be a major step forward.\" . The scientists we spoke to said investment in fossil fuels also had to be stopped, with money instead going into renewables like solar and wind. . Last week at COP, there were announcements on . cuts to coal.  and . methane. , but many scientists say they don't go far enough. . \"There needs to be a blanket stop on any foreign investment that builds and supports coal power plants or any other fossil technology\" says Prof Malte Meinhausen, of the University of Melbourne. And Dr Natalie Jones, a specialist in existential risk at the University of Cambridge, says countries need to publish robust plans and policies on how they will achieve their targets. Having plans on paper, or in law, makes it easier to get countries to stick to their word, she says. \"It provides a kind of hook that you can use to hold countries accountable because you can say, 'well, you've promised this. This is your policy statement'.\" . \"The UK, for example, has this relatively ambitious emissions reduction targets but it's concurrently . trying to open a new oil field.  at the moment,\" she added. \"The science tells us these things are fundamentally incompatible.\"  . One proposal from the scientists was for every country to have a limit on how much it can emit. . However, what the limits for countries might be, and how any scheme might work in practice, is likely to lead to difficult negotiations. Previous attempts to reach an agreement have failed. . An alternate solution, suggested by some we spoke to, was a global carbon tax system where consumers and companies, rather than governments, pay a tax on emissions. . By making business as usual more expensive, they argue, companies will be more likely to invest in cleaner technologies, which is essential to lowering emissions around the world. . \"A carbon tax needs to happen,\" says Danae Kyriakopoulou a senior policy fellow at the London School of Economics. \"We have to create incentives and create change in behaviour.\". There is support for the idea. The head of the World Trade Organization recently called for a coordinated approach to taxes on emissions. However, higher costs could be passed on to consumers who use fossil fuels to drive their cars or heat their homes. . Ms Kyriakopoulou thinks this could be managed by taking the money raised by a tax and redirecting it to reduce costs. A country could subsidise home insulation to keep homes warmer and reduce the cost of bills, for example. . Many people in developing countries, are suffering, says Dr Aditya Bahadur, a researcher at the International Institute for Environment and Development. . \"They need resources to adapt to these changes. They need knowledge and information. They need new kinds of technologies. They need protective infrastructure.\". The developed world had pledged to provide $100bn a year to poorer countries by 2020, but this has slipped to 2023. . The . US is already pledging more money. , but the scientists we spoke to said reaching the commitment as soon as possible was important. Dr Bahadur says a focus on adapting to climate change would allow countries to share technologies and advice on how to cope with extreme weather. . For example, a country that experiences droughts or floods frequently could give advice to others that have just started experiencing extreme weather events. . \"I have a colleague in Bangladesh who says Bangladesh has a lot teach to Germany about how to deal with floods.\". There is optimism for collaboration and knowledge-sharing among those we spoke to. The Covid-19 pandemic was given as an example for how countries can find ways to work together. . \"I am optimistic that a lot of good things will come out of COP26,\" says Dr Nana Ama Browne Klutse, a scientist at the university of Ghana, in Accra. She contributed to . a major UN report on climate change, published this year. .   . \"Everyone wanted to fight this pandemic. The whole world kind of became one.\" She added: \"This is how I want to see the fight against climate change. The world must come together to have this fight, with a common goal.\"."},

{"a": "A new global agreement - the Glasgow Climate Pact - was reached at the COP26 summit. It aims to reduce the worst impacts of climate change - but some leaders and campaigners say it does not go far enough. The agreement - although not legally binding - will set the global agenda on climate change for the next decade:. Emissions. It was agreed countries will meet next year to pledge further cuts to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) - a . greenhouse gas which causes climate change. . This is to try to keep temperature rises within 1.5C - which scientists say is required to prevent a \"climate catastrophe\". Current pledges, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C. . Coal. For the first time at a COP conference, there was an explicit plan to reduce use of coal - which is responsible for 40% of annual CO2 emissions.  . However, countries only agreed a weaker commitment to \"phase down\" rather than \"phase out\" coal after a late intervention by China and India. . Developing countries. The agreement pledged to significantly increase money to help poor countries cope with the effects of climate change and make the switch to clean energy. There's also the prospect of a trillion dollar a year fund from 2025 - after a previous pledge for richer countries to provide $100bn (\u00a372bn) a year by 2020 was missed. While some observers say the COP26 agreement represented the \"start of a breakthrough\", some African and Latin American countries felt not enough progress was made. . Fossil fuel subsidies. World leaders agreed to phase-out subsidies that artificially lower the price of coal, oil, or natural gas. However, no firm dates have been set. A flurry of other announcements were made:. The world's biggest CO2 emitters, the US and China, . pledged to cooperate more over the next decade.  in areas including methane emissions and the switch to clean energy. China has previously been reluctant to tackle domestic coal emissions - so this was seen as recognising the need for urgent action. . Leaders from more than 100 countries - with about 85% of the world's forests - . promised to stop deforestation.  by 2030. This is seen as vital, as trees absorb vast amounts of CO2. . Similar initiatives . haven't stopped deforestation. , but this one's better funded. However, it's unclear how the pledge will be policed. A . scheme to cut 30% of methane emissions by 2030.  was agreed by more than 100 countries. . Methane is currently responsible for a third of human-generated warming. . The big emitters China, Russia and India haven't joined - but it's hoped they will later. Financial organisations controlling $130tn . agreed to back \"clean\" technology. , such as renewable energy, and direct finance away from fossil fuel-burning industries. The initiative is an attempt to involve private companies in meeting net zero targets. However, some environmental organisations have said without a greater commitment to ending support for fossil-fuels, this could be little more than a PR exercise. . Most commitments made at COP will have to be self-policed. Only a few countries are making their pledges legally binding. . COP26 was the moment countries revisited climate pledges made made under the 2015 . Paris Agreement. . . Six years ago, countries were asked to make changes to keep global warming \"well below\" 2C - and to try to aim for 1.5C. COP stands for \"Conference of the Parties\", and the one in Glasgow was the 26th annual summit. Ahead of it, 200 countries were asked for their plans to cut emissions by 2030. . The goal is to keep cutting emissions until they reach . net zero.  by mid-century. Next year's COP27 summit is in Egypt. Top image from Getty Images.

{"a": "The Met Office says hot summers are happening more frequently. Weather readings dating back more than a century point to long-term changes in the UK's temperature. Yes, Britain has been slowly getting warmer since the 19th Century. In the past three decades, the . UK has become 0.9C warmer. . . The 10 hottest years since 1884 have all happened since 2002. And none of the coldest years has been recorded this century. In 2019, Cambridge saw the hottest temperature ever captured in the UK: 38.7C. . The summer of 2018 was the UK's second-warmest - shared with 1995 - since 1884. The hottest was in 1976. . A heatwave is a period of hot weather where temperatures are higher than is expected for the time of year. In the UK, the Met Office declares a heatwave when it records at least three days in a row with maximum temperatures exceeding a set temperature. That threshold varies by county. Heatwaves usually happen in summer when high pressure develops over an area. . They can also bring so-called \"tropical nights\" - when night-time temperatures fail to drop below 20C. . That can make it hard to sleep at night and the body can suffer, as it fails to sufficiently cool down. The Met Office says it's not clear whether heatwaves are becoming more frequent because of their sporadic nature. . Climate change is . causing global temperatures to rise. . Greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, released into Earth's atmosphere in large volumes are trapping the sun's heat, causing the planet to warm. This has brought more extreme weather, including record-breaking high temperatures across the world. Periods of intense heat do occur within natural weather patterns, . but scientists say.  that globally they are becoming more frequent, more intense and are lasting longer as a result of global warming. In the UK, . the Met Office has warned.  that summers like 2018 are 30 times more likely now than before the Industrial Revolution - the point when humans starting producing the emissions . that are responsible for climate change. . A . report on climate extremes in the UK.  found that recent years have seen both higher maximum temperatures and longer warm spells. . That trend is predicted to continue. It's possible that by 2100, . the UK could see 40C days every three to four years. . Hot weather can be dangerous particularly for the vulnerable, including elderly people, children and people with underlying health conditions. Spending too much time in high temperatures or in the sun, . can cause health issues.  such as heat stroke and cardiovascular failure. . There are also indirect effects like poorer mental health and an increase in accidents such as car crashes and drownings. . In August 2003, 20,000 people died following a heatwave in Europe lasting 10 days, . according to the Met Office. . The higher death rate starts to kick in once the thermometer passes 25C-26C. Where possible, you should modify your routine and behaviour to adapt to the heat. . If you can, travel in the morning or evening when temperatures are lower. . Wear . a high-factor sunscreen.  and a hat if you are going to spend time in the sun."},

{"a": "New targets for reducing emissions, cutting back on fossil fuels and ending deforestation were agreed by world leaders at the COP26 summit. Nations are meeting again in Bonn to discuss progress since the Glasgow Climate Pact was signed at COP26. So, are they keeping their promises?. What was agreed?. In Glasgow, countries agreed to submit more ambitious climate plans, including cuts to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2). Why does it matter?. Carbon dioxide is . a greenhouse gas which causes climate change. . Reducing emissions is needed to help keep temperature rises within 1.5C. Above this could cause \"climate catastrophe\", . according to UN scientists. . What's been done?. Countries were given a . deadline of September to submit new plans.  - but currently only 11 countries out of 196 have done so. However, recent analysis suggests that . China has seen a continuous reduction in emissions.  since summer 2021. This could have a significant impact as it is responsible for 27% of the world's emissions. What is COP and the Bonn Climate Change Conference?. What was agreed at COP26?. What was agreed?. COP26 included a plan to reduce use of coal - which is responsible for 40% of annual CO2 emissions. . World leaders also agreed to phase-out inefficient oil and gas subsidies. These are government payments that artificially lower the price of fossil fuels. . Why does it matter?. The UN climate science body, the IPCC, says . fossil fuels are responsible for 64% of the world's CO2 emissions. .  . What's been done?. There are are now 34 countries . considering new coal plants. , compared with 41 at the beginning of last year. China, . the biggest user of coal. , agreed . to stop funding.  \"all overseas coal-fired power projects completely\". . However, India - the next largest consumer of coal - . announced in April.  that it was increasing production of coal power and reopening 100 plants. . Fossil fuel subsidies also increased in 2021, . according to the International Energy Agency.  (IEA). But Sabrina Muller, policy analyst at the London School of Economics, thinks this is . a short-term measure to move away from Russian gas. . What was agreed?. More than 100 countries - with about 85% of the world's forests - . promised to stop deforestation.  by 2030. Why does it matter?. This is seen as vital, as trees absorb . about 10% of the CO2 emitted each year. What's been done?. Half the world's forests are in just five countries - Russia, Brazil, Canada, the US and China - so their actions could make a big difference. In April, US President Biden . signed an order . to protect old-growth forests on government land. . But in Brazil - home to more than half of the Amazon rainforest - . deforestation is up 69% on last year. . Frances Seymour of research group the World Resources Institute (WRI) said this was not surprising \"in light of the relaxation of environmental enforcement\" by Brazil's government. Another challenge is in Russia, which is facing a significant wildfire season. It lost . 6.5 million hectares of forest to fires last year. . What was agreed?. Richer countries agreed to provide $100bn (\u00a372bn) a year to developing nations for climate action by the end of 2022 - a pledge that was missed in 2020. . Why does it matter?. Developing nations need the money to move away from fossil fuels, by doing things like investing in green technologies. They also need to prepare for the worst impacts of climate change. . What's been done?. Despite the EU, US, Canada and Australia all increasing funding pledges, . the WRI says they need to spend more.  because of their relative wealth and previous emissions.

{"a": "China's carbon emissions are vast and growing, dwarfing those of other countries. . Experts agree that without big reductions in China's emissions, the world cannot win the fight against climate change. In 2020, China's President Xi Jinping said his country would aim for its emissions to reach their highest point before 2030 and for carbon neutrality before 2060. . His statement has now been confirmed as China's official position ahead of the COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow. But China has not said exactly how these goals will be achieved.  . While all countries face problems getting their emissions down, China is facing the biggest challenge. . Per person, China's emissions are about half those of the US, but its huge 1.4 billion population and explosive economic growth have pushed it way ahead of any other country in its overall emissions. . China became the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide in 2006 and is now responsible for more than a quarter of the world's overall greenhouse gas emissions. . It is expected to come under intense scrutiny at the COP26 summit over its commitments to reduce these. . Along with all the other signatories to the Paris Agreement in 2015, China agreed to make changes to try to keep global warming at 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, and \"well below\" 2C. China strengthened its commitments in 2020, but Climate Action Tracker, an international group of scientists and policy experts say its current actions to meet that goal are \"highly insufficient\".  . Getting China's emissions down is achievable, according to many experts, but will require a radical shift. Coal has been the country's main source of energy for decades. President Xi says China will \"phase down\" coal use from 2026 - and will . not build new coal-fired projects abroad.  - but some governments and campaigners . say the plans are not going far enough. . . Researchers at . Tsinghua University in Beijing say.  China will need to stop using coal entirely for generating electricity by 2050, to be replaced by nuclear and renewable energy production. . And far from shutting down coal-fired power stations, China is currently building new ones at more than 60 locations across the country, with many sites having more than one plant. New stations are usually active for 30 to 40 years, so China will need to reduce the capacity of newer plants as well as close old ones if it is to bring emissions down, says researcher Philippe Ciais of the Institute of Environment and Climate Science in Paris.   . It may be possible to retrofit some to capture emissions, but the technology to do so at scale is still developing, and many plants will have to be written off after minimal use. . China argues it has a right to do what Western countries have done in the past, releasing carbon dioxide in the process of developing its economy and reducing poverty. In the short term, Beijing has ordered coal mines to . increase production.  to avoid power shortages over the coming winter. Surging demand from heavy industry in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic has led to shortages in several regions of the country in recent weeks. Tsinghua University researchers say 90% of power should come from nuclear and renewables by 2050. In moving towards that goal, China's lead in the manufacture of green technology, such as solar panels and large-scale batteries, may be a big help. . China first embraced green technologies as a means to tackle air pollution, a serious problem for many cities. . But the government also believes they have enormous economic potential, providing jobs and income for millions of Chinese, as well as reducing China's dependence on foreign oil and gas. \"China is already leading the global energy transition,\" says Yue Cao of the Overseas Development Institute. \"One of the reasons we are able to deploy cheaper and cheaper green technology is China.\" . China generates more solar power than any other country. That might not be so impressive given China's enormous population, but it is a sign of where the country is heading. China's wind power installations were more than triple those of any other country in 2020. China says the proportion of its energy generated from non-fossil fuel sources should be 25% by 2030, and it is expected by many observers to hit the target early. . China ranks seventh in the world for its percentage of car sales that are electric, but given its huge size, China makes and buys more electric cars than any other country by a considerable margin. . Currently, about one in 20 cars bought in China is electric-powered. By 2035, Chinese officials and car industry representatives are predicting that almost all new vehicles sold in China will be fully electric-powered or hybrid. Working out by how much the shift to electric vehicles reduces emissions is not straightforward - particularly when taking into account manufacturing and charging sources. . But studies suggest that emissions over the lifetimes of electric vehicles are typically below those of petrol and diesel equivalents. . This matters because transport is responsible for around a quarter of carbon emissions from fuel combustion, with . road vehicles.  being the largest emitters. . China will also by 2025 be producing batteries with double the capacity of those produced by the rest of the world combined. Observers say that will enable the storage and release of energy from renewable sources on a previously impossible scale. Getting to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions doesn't mean that China will stop producing emissions. It means China will cut emissions as much as possible and absorb what's left, through a combination of different approaches. Increasing the area of land covered in vegetation will help, as plants absorb carbon dioxide. Here again, there is encouraging news. China is . getting greener.  at a faster rate than any other country, largely as a result of its forestry programmes designed to reduce soil erosion and pollution. It is also partly a result of replanting fields to produce more than one harvest per year, which keeps land covered in vegetation for longer. . The world needs China to succeed. . \"Unless China decarbonises, we're not going to beat climate change,\" says prof David Tyfield of the Lancaster Environment Centre. China has some big advantages, particularly its capacity to stick to long-term strategies and mobilise large-scale investments.  . The Chinese authorities are facing a colossal task. What happens next could hardly be more important."},

{"a": "Scientists and politicians say we are facing a planetary crisis because of climate change. . But what's the evidence for global warming and how do we know it's being caused by humans? . Our planet has been warming rapidly since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution.  . The . average temperature at the Earth's surface has risen about 1.1C since 1850. . Furthermore, each of the last four decades has been warmer than any that preceded it, since the middle of the 19th Century. . These conclusions come from analyses of millions of measurements gathered in different parts of the world. The temperature readings are collected by . weather stations on land, on ships and by satellites. . . Multiple independent teams of scientists have reached the same result - a spike in temperatures coinciding with the onset of the industrial era. . Scientists can reconstruct temperature fluctuations even further back in time. . Tree rings, ice cores, lake sediments and corals all record a signature of the past climate. This provides much-needed context to the current phase of warming. In fact, scientists estimate the Earth hasn't been this hot for about 125,000 years. . Greenhouse gases - which trap the Sun's heat - are the crucial link between temperature rise and human activities. The most important is carbon dioxide (CO2), because of its abundance in the atmosphere. We can also tell it's CO2 trapping the Sun's energy. Satellites show less heat from the Earth escaping into space at precisely the wavelengths at which CO2 absorbs radiated energy. . Burning fossil fuels and chopping down trees lead to the release of this greenhouse gas. Both activities exploded after the 19th Century, so it's unsurprising that atmospheric CO2 increased over the same period. . There's a way we can show definitively where this extra CO2 came from. The carbon produced by burning fossil fuels has a distinctive chemical signature. . Tree rings and polar ice both record changes in atmospheric chemistry. When examined they show that carbon - specifically from fossil sources - . has risen significantly since 1850. .  . Analysis shows that for 800,000 years, atmospheric CO2 did not rise above 300 parts per million (ppm). But since the Industrial Revolution, the CO2 concentration has soared to its current level of nearly 420 ppm. Computer simulations, known as climate models, have been used to show what would have happened to temperatures without the massive amounts of greenhouse gases released by humans.  . They reveal there would have been little global warming - and possibly some cooling - over the 20th and 21st Centuries, if only natural factors had been influencing the climate. . Only when human factors are introduced can the models explain increases in temperature.  . The level of heating Earth has experienced already is predicted to cause significant changes to the world around us. . Real-world observations of these changes match patterns scientists expect to see with human-induced warming. They include:. There have been several hot periods during the Earth's past. Around 92 million years ago, for example, temperatures were so high that . there were no polar ice caps and crocodile-like creatures lived as far north as the Canadian Arctic. . . That should not comfort anyone, however, because humans were not around. At times in the past, sea level was 25m (80ft) higher than the present. . A rise of 5-8m (16-26ft) is considered enough to submerge most of the world's coastal cities. . There is abundant evidence for mass extinctions of life during these periods. And climate models suggest that, at times, . the tropics could have become \"dead zones\". , too hot for most species to survive. These fluctuations between hot and cold have been caused by a variety of phenomena, including the way the Earth wobbles as it orbits the Sun over long periods, volcanic eruptions and short-term climate cycles such as El Ni\u00f1o. For many years, groups of so-called climate \"sceptics\" have cast doubt on the scientific basis of global warming. . However, virtually all scientists who publish regularly in peer-reviewed journals now agree on the current causes of climate change.  . A key UN report released in 2021 said it \"is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, oceans and land\". . The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives. Top image credit: Getty Images.

{"a": "World temperatures are rising because of human activity, and climate change now threatens every aspect of human life. Left unchecked, humans and nature will experience catastrophic warming, with worsening droughts, greater sea level rise and mass extinction of species. . We face a huge challenge, but there are potential solutions. Climate is the average weather in a place over many years. Climate change is a shift in those average conditions. The rapid climate change we are now seeing is caused by humans using oil, gas and coal for their homes, factories and transport. . When these fossil fuels burn, they release greenhouse gases - mostly carbon dioxide (CO2). These gases trap the Sun's heat and cause the planet's temperature to rise. The world is now about 1.2C warmer than it was in the 19th Century - and . the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has risen by 50%. . Temperature rises must slow down if we want to avoid the worst consequences of climate change, scientists say. They say global warming needs to be . kept to 1.5C by 2100. . . However, unless further action is taken, . the planet could still warm by more than 2C.  by the end of this century. A report in 2021 by the Climate Action Tracker group calculated that the world was heading for . 2.4C of warming by the end of the century. If nothing is done, . scientists think global warming could exceed 4C.  in the future, leading to devastating heatwaves, millions losing their homes to rising sea levels and irreversible loss of plant and animal species. . Extreme weather events are already more intense, threatening lives and livelihoods. . With further warming, some regions could become uninhabitable, as . farmland turns into desert. . In other regions, the opposite is happening, with extreme rainfall causing historic flooding - as seen recently in China, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. People in poorer countries will suffer the most as they do not have the money to adapt to climate change. Many farms in developing countries already have to endure climates that are too hot and this will only get worse. Our oceans and its habitats are also under threat. The Great Barrier Reef in Australia, for example, has already . lost half of its corals since 1995.  due to warmer seas driven by climate change. Wildfires are becoming more frequent.  as climate change increases the risk of hot, dry weather. . And as frozen ground melts in places like Siberia, greenhouse gases trapped for centuries will be released into the atmosphere, worsening climate change. In a warmer world, animals will find it harder to find the food and water they need to live. For example, polar bears could die out as the ice they rely on melts away, and elephants will struggle to find the 150-300 litres of water a day they need. Scientists believe . at least 550 species could be lost this century.  if action is not taken. . Climate change has different effects in different areas of the world. Some places will warm more than others, some will receive more rainfall and others will face more droughts. . If temperature rise cannot be kept within 1.5C:. Countries agree climate change can only be tackled by working together, and in a landmark agreement in Paris in 2015, they pledged to try to keep global warming to 1.5C. . The UK is hosting a summit for world leaders, . called COP26,.  in November, where countries will set out their carbon reduction plans for 2030. . Many countries have pledged to get to net zero by 2050. This means reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible and balancing out remaining emissions by absorbing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere. Experts agree that . this is achievable. , but it will require governments, businesses and individuals to make big changes. Major changes need to come from governments and businesses, but scientists say some small changes in our lives . can limit our impact on the climate. :.

{"a": "Climate change threatens the health and survival of urban trees, with more than half of species already feeling the heat, according to a new study. City-dwelling oaks, maples, poplars, elms, pines and chestnuts are among more than 1,000 tree species flagged at risk due to climate change. . Scientists want better protection of existing trees and for drought-resistant varieties to be planted. Trees have cooling effects and provide shade, making cities more liveable. Many trees in urban areas are already stressed because of climate change, and as it gets warmer and drier, the number of species at potential risk will increase, said  Manuel Esperon-Rodriguez of Western Sydney University in Penrith, Australia. City and street trees can improve physical and mental health, are important in social integration and can mitigate the effects of temperature rises - something that hit home during the pandemic, he said. \"All these benefits are mainly provided by big mature trees so we need to make sure that what we are planting today will get to that stage where they can provide all those benefits for future generations,\" he told BBC News. The researchers used the Global Urban Tree Inventory - a database recording more than 4,000 different trees and shrubs planted in 164 cities in 78 countries - to assess the likely impact of global warming on the trees planted along streets and in parks. Of the 164 cities analysed, more than half of tree species are already at risk in some cities due to rising temperatures and changes in rainfall. And by 2050, this proportion is predicted to rise to more than two-thirds. Climate risk for species in urban areas is particularly high in cities in tropical regions, and in vulnerable countries such as India, Niger, Nigeria and Togo. In the UK, the researchers looked at five cities: Belfast, Birmingham, Bristol, London and York. They found that drier weather under climate change is expected to have a big impact on trees, particularly in York, London and Birmingham.

{"a": "It's the end of week one at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, and world leaders have already made some big commitments. More than 40 countries have promised to phase out coal by 2050, and another 100 leaders have pledged to end and reverse deforestation by 2030. . The US and EU, meanwhile, announced that they would partner up to cut methane emissions. BBC reporters across the globe - from Shanghai to Sao Paulo - explain how the summit and the climate pledges are going down in their countries. Chinese social media has not been flooded with criticism of the West at COP26, writes . Stephen McDonell.  in Beijing. The response in China's state-controlled media to the climate summit has been fairly muted. It's not that ordinary people in China don't know that the conference is taking place, but the coverage of it has definitely been downplayed. Perhaps Xi Jinping choosing not to attend the gathering was a key factor. To report on it might draw attention to the fact that, unlike other major nations, nobody represented China at leader level. Also, China's media is of the Communist Party and for the Communist Party. Coverage of anything involving Mr Xi, who is the General Secretary of the Party, is tightly controlled. Media outlets here would not ignore such a meeting - to which Mr Xi sent a message in lieu of an appearance - unless they had been ordered to. Of course the conference has, at various points, been referred to. Nationalist stirrers - like those featured in the Global Times - have criticised US President Joe Biden, particularly after he singled out his Chinese counterpart for not showing up. But Chinese social media have not been flooded with criticism of the West at COP26 - it's all been fairly subdued. Perhaps, for climate scientists wanting to build a sense of urgency and momentum out of this summit, ignoring what's happening there may be worse than attacking it. It's all about domestic politics, writes . Laura Trevelyan.  in New York. President Biden was determined to use COP26 to showcase American leadership on climate on the world stage - but, as MSNBC opinion columnist Hayes Brown noted, first of all, he had to apologise. Since President Trump pulled the US out of the Paris climate accord, that \"put us sort of behind the eight ball a little bit,' he acknowledged on the summit's first day. . The US has a see-saw approach to global climate agreements depending on which party has the presidency. So Americans know that whatever is agreed in Glasgow could be reversed by a Republican president in 2025. The conservative-leaning Wall St Journal pointed out that President Biden tried to paint Russia and China as \"isolated holdouts\" to a global consensus on reducing emissions but efforts by the US and its allies failed to get Moscow and Beijing to budge. At home it's the position of Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, a crucial vote when it comes to getting a $500bn climate plan through Congress, that's getting attention. Mr Manchin is from a coal producing state, West Virginia, and when he said he had lingering concerns about the spending package, headlines declared: \"Biden's climate pledge risks being undermined by holdout senator.\". There is no sense of a climate emergency in Russia, writes . Steve Rosenberg.  in Moscow. Go compare. . A British newspaper headline this week - Queen's plea to save our 'fragile' planet. Russia's most popular (pro-Kremlin) daily - Should we really be scared of global warming?. It concluded we shouldn't, claiming there are \"positive consequences of global warming\" (especially for Russia): lower heating bills, more accessible shipping routes. There's no sense here of a climate emergency. . Not that the Kremlin denies there's a problem. It points out that the climate in Russia is warming 2.5 times faster than the world average. . It sent a big delegation to Glasgow. No president, though. Vladimir Putin appeared by video screen only. . Still, Russia promises to be carbon neutral by 2060. It signed the Glasgow declaration on forests and land use, pledging an end to deforestation by 2030. But it wouldn't sign up to cutting methane emissions 30% by 2030. Russia is a fossil fuel superpower and wants a \"smooth\" (longer) transition to greener energy. \"Everybody wants Russia to do more to achieve carbon neutrality as soon as possible,\" Vasily Yablokov of Greenpeace Russia tells me. . \"I'm happy Russia now accepts climate change is happening, but I see no high ambition from our country. It looks like the Russian government's from another planet.\" . India's 2070 net zero pledge has won Narendra Modi applause in a growing nation balancing economic and environmental needs, writes . Rajini Vaidyanathan.  in Delhi. Although India has been a big talking point among policy makers in the weeks leading up to the COP summit, COP hasn't been such a big topic for India's masses. But on Monday, when Prime Minister Modi announced that the country would commit to net zero by 2070, many who weren't paying much attention to goings on in Glasgow finally took note. . Mr Modi's address was broadcast on prime time here, and while some around the world are frustrated India is signing up to meet these goals two decades later than the global 2050 target, here the pledges were seen as pragmatic in a growing country which needs to balance both economic and environmental needs. . They were also viewed by many as a reminder that the PM won't succumb to pressure when the West has long reaped the benefits of growth while polluting. As Mr Modi reminded the summit, \"India, which is 17% of the world population, is responsible for less than 5% of emissions\" - a line that many here applauded. . The First Post news website called the 2070 pledge a \"bold decision... without capitulating to the uncalled for bullying by the West\". And climate experts here say India's four shorter-term goals - to scale up renewables and reduce carbon emissions by 2030 - are also significant. Australia's part in the Cop26 summit is overshadowed by politics writes.  Shaimaa Khalil.  in Sydney. Part of Scott Morrison's job at Cop26 was to explain to the world how he was going to deliver on net zero by 2050 without phasing out coal. But the prime minister's trip to Glasgow was overshadowed by a row with French President Emmanuel Macron - and not about the climate, about submarines.  . On Sunday in Glasgow, Mr Macron accused Mr Morrison of lying to him about a $37bn deal with France which collapsed under controversial circumstances. Mr Morrison replied by saying his nation would not accept \"sledging\" or \"slurs\". . And so this past week, rather than discussing the pressing climate debate and what Australia had achieved at COP26, most of the commentary here has been about Mr Morrison's character and whether the row will affect his standing domestically. \"Slipperiness is Scott Morrison's defining characteristic,\" wrote journalist Hugh Riminton in the Guardian. \"And it was never more on show than this week as he sold \"the Australian Way\" on climate to a sceptical crowd in Glasgow, while openly being branded a liar by France.\". Australia did make a few climate headlines in Glasgow. Along with China, Russia, India and Iran, it snubbed the international pledge to reduce methane emissions by 30% by 2030, and refused to sign up to phasing out coal-fired power and stop investing in new coal plants at home and abroad.  . The verdict from Australia's ABC News? A \"terribly messy week\" for the prime minister. The climate conference in Scotland feels a long way from the reality of most Brazilians, writes . Katy Watson.  in S\u00e3o Paulo. Much is made of Brazil's contribution to climate change internationally because of its immense rainforest. But with all that President Jair Bolsonaro says and does - and the fact he didn't even attend COP26 - it feels a bit different over here. . Yes, the Amazon is in the same country, but it's a long way from big cities like S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio, and probably feels just as distant as a climate conference in Scotland. . It's not that Brazilians don't care. \"People do want to participate and they have lots to contribute,\" says Silvia Cervellini, co-founder of Delibera, a Brazilian organisation helping people get involved in politics. But since the pandemic, there's been a rise in poverty and the political and economic crisis is casting a shadow over Brazil. People have more immediate concerns. \"What we need to do is enable people to make the connection with daily life,\" Ms Cervellini says. . And that's something that dressmaker Izildete Maria de Sousa Botelho agrees with. The 67-year-old from Minas Gerais state was selected to be part of the Global Citizen Assembly for COP. \"If we are cutting down trees, we need to rethink what we eat,\" she says. \"We outsource the responsibility to authorities and politicians and forget that it's individual actions, it's the lack of ecological awareness that we need to work on that is causing all of this.\". Many in Iran believe that it is unfair to expect the country to make any climate commitments while the sanctions remain, writes BBC Persian Service correspondent . Siavash Ardalan. . Iran is among the top 10 emitters of greenhouse gases and suffers extensively from the effects of global warming. The country has seen one its worst droughts in decades this year, . resulting in severe water shortages.  and electricity blackouts. US sanctions and unsustainable domestic policies have only exacerbated such problems. One member of Iran's delegation to COP26 has said that if the sanctions were lifted, \"there would be no obstacle for us to reduce our emissions\". However, conservatives affiliated to President Ebrahim Raisi's government have put out statements that range from climate change denial to assertions COP26 is seeking to deprive Iran of its oil and gas. Although the summit has been largely ignored by Iranian media, such critical views have made their way to some pro-government conservative outlets. A few reform-minded newspapers have meanwhile echoed the dire warnings from UN officials and climate scientists while avoiding any critique of the government's low-key approach to COP26. . Public opinion is divided. Many believe that it is unfair to expect any commitments from Iran while the sanctions remain in place. Others argue that climate change has only served to downplay government incompetence. . COP26 is not front page news in Nigeria, writes.  Nduka Orjinmo.  in Abuja. Nigeria, Africa's largest oil exporter, has promised zero emissions by 2060. The big media houses have sent reporters to Glasgow but it is not front page news in Nigeria. . On Wednesday, President Muhammadu Buhari said no-one in Nigeria needed \"persuading of the need for urgent action on the environment,\" pointing to desertification, floods and erosion in the country as \"enough evidence\". But he wants access to climate finance - some of the $100bn annually available to developing economies - and foreign investment in Nigeria's gas sector to help the country wean itself off its major revenue earner, oil. The president struck the right notes for those in Glasgow but back home people, in homes powered by gasoline generators imported from China, live in a different reality. No-one here has experienced a stable power supply in their lifetime and if it takes burning coal to achieve that, few will reject it for the sake of the climate. Climate activists, especially in the oil-producing Niger Delta region, have long sounded the alarm about the impact of oil drilling and gas flaring but there is little sign of any action from the government and the international oil firms. Even as Saudi Arabia seeks to achieve net zero by 2060, the country is boosting its oil production, writes Middle East Business Correspondent.  Sameer Hashmi. . For a long time, the world's largest oil exporter, Saudi Arabia, had resisted calls from Western countries to set a definite target to reduce carbon emissions. . Then last month, the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, announced that the country had set a goal of reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2060. . But, even as the Saudis seek to achieve that objective, they are boosting their oil production capacity to cater for global demand. The country's top officials have repeatedly said tackling climate change is necessary, but that it cannot be done by \"demonising\" hydrocarbons. The energy minister believes the world needs both fossil fuels as well as renewables. Most officials I spoke to there supported the crown prince's goal and his efforts to promote economic diversification by investing in new industries. The response by environmental activists though was more muted."},

{"a": "Fracking can go ahead in England, the government said on Thursday, lifting a ban on the controversial process. A moratorium was put in place in 2019 following concerns over earth tremors. But with the energy crisis worsening globally and world leaders scrambling to secure energy supplies, the question has been reopened. . The decision comes alongside the publication of a new scientific review into the practice by the British Geological Survey (BGS). . The BGS has concluded there is still a limited understanding of the impacts of such drilling - a way of mining gas and oil from shale rock. \"In light of (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's illegal invasion of Ukraine and weaponisation of energy, strengthening our energy security is an absolute priority\", Business and Energy Secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg said in a statement announcing the end of the ban. Fracking in the UK has been a controversial subject within local communities and amongst MPs due to its association with minor earthquakes. In 2019, at oil and gas exploration company Cuadrilla's fracking site in Lancashire, . more than 120 tremors were recorded.  -  although most were too small to be felt. Alongside the announcement on Thursday the government . published a new review. , commissioned in April, from the British Geological Survey (BGS) which considers any changes to the science around the practice. On the risk of larger tremors from fracking the report concludes: \"Forecasting the occurrence of large earthquakes\u2026 remains a scientific challenge for the geoscience community.\". Within shale rock there can be small faults and areas of stress. During drilling, water is injected into the rock to extract the gas. The water lubricates the shale rock, moving parts of the rock along these faults. This movement can trigger a tremor. The BGS points out that although there has been progress in identifying these faults there is limited exploration and therefore \"it is not possible to identify all faults that could host earthquakes with magnitudes of up to 3\u2026even with the best available data\". \"The BGS report indicates that in terms of the science, little has changed since the 2019 moratorium on fracking,\" said Honorary Professor Andrew Aplin, at Durham University Earth Sciences Department. He was not involved in the review. This worries campaigners and locals who fought to stop the practice. . \"Ripping up the rules that protect people from fracking would send shockwaves through local communities,\" said Friends of the Earth energy campaigner Danny Gross. \"This announcement suggests that the government is planning to throw communities under the bus by forcing them to accept 'a higher degree of risk and disturbance.\". But Rees-Mogg said in his statement that: \"tolerating a higher degree of risk and disturbance appears to us (the government) to be in the national interest given the circumstances.\". The House of Commons on Thursday saw . heated debate on the issue between Rees-Mogg and Labour's shadow climate change secretary Ed Miliband. Rees-Mogg said it was \"important\" to use all available sources of fuel within the UK rather than import them. But Milliband said this would not lower energy costs and reminded Mr Rees-Mogg of a 2019 Tory manifesto pledge not to support fracking unless it could be done safely. Some of the criticisms of fracking don't make much sense. Critics say chasing the methane trapped in ancient shale rocks will prove too difficult and expensive to ever be profitable. That is no reason to keep the moratorium.  Companies should be free to decide whether they think it is worth doing or not. Or how about the claim local communities will never allow it?  Surely, they should decide. The important question is whether we need this new source of fossil fuels at all. We know any additional carbon dioxide in the atmosphere adds to the problem of climate change. What is more, fracking won't affect the price you pay for your energy. That's because the frackers - just like the oil and gas companies in the North Sea - will sell whatever gas they produce to the highest bidder, as INEOS made clear when I spoke to the company last week. Companies involved in fracking including Cuadrilla welcomed the lifting of the ban. Cuadrilla Chief Executive Officer Francis Egan told the BBC News Channel that the first gas could be flowing in six months, although that would depend on local planning approvals. Even with the reversal of the ban, permit arrangements still remain very strict. Currently if there is any seismic activity at fracking sites companies have to proceed with caution. And they have to pause activity altogether if there is a tremor over 0.5 magnitude. The BGS says that earthquakes can only be felt at a measurement of 2.0 - which is thirty times stronger than this. . Chris Hopkinson, chief executive officer for UK gas and oil exploration company IGas Energy, told BBC's Newsnight programme earlier this week that this was a lot stricter than the requirements for other sectors, saying: \"We just want to play on a level playing field.\". Rees-Mogg told Newsnight on Wednesday night that . the level of seismic activity would be reviewed, but said it was too early to confirm what that new level would be. The Scottish and Welsh governments continue to oppose fracking, and say they will not use their powers to grant drilling licences."},

{"a": "Why are we seeing such brutal temperatures? . Climate scientists say the answer is climate change. . The Met Office estimates that the extreme heat we are seeing has been made ten times more likely because of it. . We are being warned it can pose a life-threatening risk to even normally healthy people, and just look at the impact it is having in our hospitals, schools and transport systems. . Now remember, this is happening when average world temperatures have only risen just over 1C beyond levels seen before many parts of the world became industrialised. One degree doesn't sound much, does it?  But we're living in the hottest period for 125,000 years, according to the UN's climate science body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). We know what's behind this - the greenhouse gas emissions caused by our burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas, which trap heat in our atmosphere. They have helped push the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to the highest levels seen for 2 million years, according to the IPCC. . So where is our climate headed? . The target set by the UN is to limit global temperature increases to 1.5C higher than pre-industrial levels.  It says that should avoid the most dangerous impacts of climate change. To do that, emissions need to have peaked by 2025 - yes, in only two and half years. . CO2 emissions from energy increased by 6% in 2021 to 36.3 billion tonnes - the highest ever level, the International Energy Agency estimates. They need to virtually halve by 2030 - we need a minimum 43% reduction by the end of this decade, according to the IPCC. . Then the world needs to scale back emissions to net zero by 2050.  That means cutting greenhouse gases as much as possible and finding ways to draw CO2 out of the atmosphere to make up for any that remain. It is a huge challenge - many people believe the greatest challenge humanity has ever faced. . Remember that big UN conference in Glasgow last year? If all the promises governments made there were actually implemented, then we'd be looking at temperatures rising by something like 2.4C from pre-industrial levels by the end of the century. . But the truth is even if we do succeed in reducing emissions to that really ambitious 1.5C target, UK summers will continue to get hotter. . \"In a few decades this might actually be a quite a cool summer,\" says Professor Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College London. We should expect more and longer heatwaves in the future, says Professor Nigel Arnell, a climate scientist at Reading University. We will be seeing more heat-health alerts, more heat-stress days - days when it is too hot to work - and damaging heat extremes to increase, he warns. . So what is the UK doing about it?. Nowhere near enough, is the stark conclusion of the Climate Change Committee (CCC), the government's advisors on climate change. Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned the world was at \"one minute to midnight\" on climate change in his speech opening the Glasgow climate conference. . But in a report on the UK's progress towards net zero the CCC warned that his government's current policies are very unlikely to do the job. It said the government has set a lot of targets and put a lot of policies in place but warns there is \"scant evidence\" these goals will be delivered. And the country is not doing enough to prepare itself for the more frequent and intense heatwaves climate change will bring. Heatwaves caused an additional 2,000 deaths in 2020, according to the UK Health Security Agency. . That figure is likely to triple in coming decades without government action, according to Baroness Brown, deputy chair of the Climate Change Committee. \"We've been telling the government for over 10 years that we are nothing like well enough prepared in the UK for the really hot weather we are seeing now,\" she says - particularly the extreme heat many people experience in their homes. . It is a \"disgrace\" people are dying of heat - or for that matter cold - in the UK, says Professor Hannah Cloke of the University of Reading. Most UK buildings and infrastructure were not designed to cope with the kind of temperatures we are seeing this week and much more needs to be done to adapt them, she says. \"We have made great strides in forecasting extreme weather and climate conditions in recent years. Now we need the systems in place so that people and governments act on the warnings we can provide, whether three hours, three days, or three decades in advance.\"."},

{"a": "The calls are growing louder. Pakistan desperately needs help after its worst floods in years, and it needs it fast. \"This climate calamity couldn't have come at a worse time, when Pakistan's economy was already struggling with a balance of payments crisis, rising debt, and soaring inflation,\" Maleeha Lodhi, former Pakistan ambassador to the UN and the UK, told the BBC. If the country doesn't get debt relief, she added, the economy risks \"tanking\". Catastrophic rain linked to climate change has submerged large parts of the country, killing nearly 1,500 people and affecting roughly 33 million people. . Homes, roads, railways, crops, livestock and livelihoods have been washed away in the extreme weather event. With agriculture making up nearly a quarter of Pakistan's economy, officials now say the unprecedented floods may have cost up to $40bn (\u00a335bn). . Across the country, . an estimated 800,000 cattle.  - a key source of income for rural families - have been lost in the floods. Farmers who have not had their crops and livestock washed away are now reportedly running low on feed for their cattle. There will likely be more pain ahead with a food crisis looming. Roughly 70% of the onion harvest, along with rice and corn, has been destroyed, according to Pakistan's climate change minister, Sherry Rehman. . Pakistan is the world's fourth largest rice exporter, with markets in Africa and China. . Almost all of Pakistan's households are consumers of wheat, but with so much agricultural land damaged, the wheat harvest could be at risk too. . Food prices are already under pressure because of the post-pandemic supply chain disruption and the war in Ukraine, which is a major global supplier of key crops. Pakistan's inflation rate was more than 24% before the floods, according to reports, and some costs have climbed by 500%. . Authorities may need to import food to feed people and raw materials for industry, but the country's foreign reserves were . running low even before the crisis. . Pakistan is also a producer of cotton, which is used in the country's textile industry - a major employer. Manufacturers are bracing for a shortage of that too. On Sunday, Pakistan's finance minister Miftah Ismail said the country would \"absolutely not\" default on its debt payments despite the floods. Mr Ismail also said that external financing sources had been secured, including more than $4bn (\u00a33.5bn) from the Asian Development Bank, Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and World Bank. About $5bn of investments from Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia would be made in the current financial year, he added. At the same time, Pakistan's central bank announced that Saudi Arabia's development authority had extended a deposit of $3bn, which had been due for repayment in December, by one year. Also on Sunday, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said it would work with countries around the world international community to support Pakistan's relief and reconstruction efforts. Last month, an IMF bailout package was approved but conditions were attached, like raising taxes and applying austerity measures. Andrew Wood, an analyst at S&P Global Ratings, flagged \"high inflation, a weaker currency, and tighter fiscal and monetary conditions\" as affecting growth in a recent briefing. He added that the agency estimated the government's debt position was around 74% of GDP. \"Financial support from the IMF and other multilateral and bilateral partners is critical, in our view... Structural reforms that support Pakistan's business environment and macroeconomic stability would be important pillars of an enduring economic recovery,\" Mr Wood said. The floods were caused by record rainfall during the monsoon season and melting glaciers in the mountains. The South Asian nation received nearly 190% more rain than the 30-year average, in July and August. The southern province of Sindh received 466% more rain than average. . When UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres visited Pakistan last week, he blamed climate change for the disaster and said the country needed massive financial support. . \"I have seen many, many humanitarian disasters in the world. But I have never seen climate carnage on this scale. I have simply no words to describe what I have seen today, a flooded area that is three times the total area of my own country, Portugal,\" Mr Guterres said. Aid agencies are now assessing the scale of the reconstruction effort, and with entire villages underwater, a public health crisis is inevitable. . Weather officials say more rain is expected in the coming days, putting thousands of displaced people at further risk. ."},

{"a": "Windfall profits made by fossil fuel companies should be taxed to pay for climate damage, according to the UN Secretary General. Antonio Guterres told the General Assembly that polluters should pay for the impact of climate-related events. This question of who funds these losses has long dogged international negotiations. Poor countries say the rich should pay because of their historic carbon emissions. . But richer nations reject any calls for compensation. Arguments over this question are likely to dominate discussions at the forthcoming COP27 summit in Egypt. . As world leaders gather for the UN General Assembly in New York this week, there's no shortage of critical issues on their agenda. . From the war in Ukraine, to food and energy shortages and cost-of-living crises, \"a global winter of discontent\" is on the horizon, according to Mr Guterres. . Central to that is the question of climate change, which the Secretary General believes to be the defining issue of our time. It is a case study in moral and economic justice, he says. . Having recently seen the devastating . flooding in Pakistan.  for himself, Mr Guterres is now doubling down on the need for the rich world to urgently address the demands of the poor. . And there's little doubt whom he believes is responsible for the world's climate emergency. \"The fossil fuel industry is feasting on hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies and windfall profits while household budgets shrink and our planet burns,\" he told the Assembly. \"Today, I am calling on all developed economies to tax the windfall profits of fossil fuel companies. Those funds should be re-directed in two ways: to countries suffering loss and damage caused by the climate crisis; and to people struggling with rising food and energy prices.\". The question of who pays for the impact of climate change that poorer countries cannot adapt to has been a bone of contention between rich and poor for more than a decade. . Richer nations baulk at the idea of paying \"compensation\" for their historic emissions of carbon dioxide which have driven up temperatures. . Mr Guterres' team are quick to point out that the Secretary General is not talking about reparations or a funding facility. They believe the money could be used for practical steps - such as early warning systems - that would benefit struggling nations. . But warning systems alone won't cut much ice with small island and developing states, which believe this issue of loss and damage funding is fundamental to their survival. . According to . newspaper reports. , some of the world's poorest countries have prepared a discussion document for this week's gathering in New York that looks to a \"climate-related and justice-based\" global tax as a means of raising finance. . Among the options are a carbon tax, a tax on airline travel and a levy on the heavy oils used in shipping. . It is unlikely that these proposals will be adopted - and the long-running battle over loss and damage will continue at COP27 in Sharm el Sheikh in November. Developing countries will continue to push strongly for faster progress on finance for loss and damage, and they will at least have moral support from the UN Secretary General. . At COP26 in Glasgow, all countries agreed that there should be a new framework on this issue, but there was no agreement on how it should be funded. . Follow Matt on Twitter . @mattmcgrathbbc. ."},

{"a": "Imagine if you could put an ultra-thin, transparent solar sheet on your window to generate energy, not just from sunlight but also artificial lights from inside your room?. Seen as the most promising next-generation solar cell, this technology, called perovskite, is exactly what Japanese start-up Enecoat Technologies is trying to develop. . When ready, the Kyoto-based firm hopes its product will produce as much power as a regular solar panel of the same size. \"We are hoping to market them in three to four years,\" says the co-founder and chief executive of the company, Naoya Kato. \"But to use them outdoors, we need to make them durable for any kind of weather conditions, so that will take longer.\" . Start-ups such as this are called \"deep tech\". They are small firms who are merging high-tech engineering innovation with scientific discovery. The hope is that it will lead to the development of transformational products. But a successful product launch in this sector takes time. As a result, private venture capital funds that lend money to entrepreneurs may be more cautious to invest in them. . That is where Kyoto University plays a crucial role. It may be . best known for producing more Nobel prize winners than any other university in Asia (11 in total),.  but it also finances new start-ups by students and researchers through its two venture capital funds. Enecoat Technologies is one of the beneficiaries, and has received a total of 500m yen ($3.6m; \u00a33m). The money came from a $300m fund that the university received from the Japanese government back in 2015 to encourage entrepreneurship. \"Kyoto University is strong in very hard science fields like regenerative medicine, stem cell science, and cleantech energy,\" says Koji Murota, who heads the university's Office of Society-Academia Collaboration for Innovation. . \"But in order to commercialise these deep-tech companies it requires a long time and a large amount of money.\". Mr Murota adds that while a typical venture capital fund's investment period may be eight to 10 years, that is not long enough for deep tech, so the university's scheme offers up to 20 years of support. Since Kyoto University started its innovation department and investment fund seven years ago, the number of start-ups created by its students have more than doubled to 242. New Tech Economy.  is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape. That is second only to Tokyo University, which also received similar funding from the government, but Kyoto University's growth rate is much higher. But even before the university started offering support to entrepreneurs, the city of Kyoto was known for producing start-ups. These include Nintendo. It may be a computer game giant today, but when it launched way back in 1889 it made playing cards. Another successful firm set up in Kyoto is tech giant Kyocera, . which was founded in 1959 by the late Kazuo Inamori, one of Japan's best-known business leaders. . A more recent business success story in the city is microchip manufacturer and fellow deep-tech start-up Flosfia. Also backed by the university, it makes semiconductors that specialise in using energy more efficiently, thereby extending the lifespan of the product, such as electric cars. \"Kyoto's uniqueness is being small and yet diverse,\" says Kyoto University graduate and the boss of Flosfia, Toshimi Hitora. \"The university is at the heart of it, and with so many researchers in a small community, anyone can access the information you need to start a business. \"But all the Kyoto-based companies' founders also say that, unlike firms in Tokyo, they don't have enough customers here [in Kyoto], so they had to think globally from the beginning.\". Mr Hitora adds: \"It has been more than 10 years since we started Flosfia because deep tech takes time, and I feel Kyoto people understand that.\". Some 30 years ago, Japan was a pioneer in the semiconductor industry, but today it has less than 10% market share. For Flosfia to establish a significant presence in the highly competitive global semiconductor industry, one dominated by firms such as South Korea's Samsung and Taiwan's TSMC, will be a challenge, especially as China and the US are also trying to put their stamp on the market. In the US this move is being led by the White House, with the House of Representatives passing a government act in July that commits . a $280bn support package for domestic chip production and research.  The US wishes to reduce its dependence on other nations for supplies. But Mr Hitora believes that Japanese producers like his have their own strengths. \"Japan is good at doing basic research, and working with new materials, so I feel we have a big potential,\" he says. He adds that Flosfia now has alliances with most of Taiwan's main chip manufacturers. \"Semiconductors are needed globally, so some governments may try to intervene to ensure the supply for their home markets, but it takes a long time to produce semiconductors,\" says Mr Hitora. \"To mass produce them, we need a lot of stakeholders and a lot of businesses in many countries. That is why I believe our alliances with other companies are important.\". As Japan plays catch-up in the semiconductor sector, Kyoto University's ability to patiently play the long game with firms such as Flosfia increases the hope that the country will be successful. .

{"a": "In a world where energy supplies can seem increasingly at risk, one couple living in the mountains of British Columbia, Canada, have taken matters into their own hands. . Katie Erickson and Greg Mooney are building their dream home - and it's off-grid. Their goal is to be as self-sufficient as possible and so have installed solar panels, batteries and a back-up generator. \"We see no shortage of natural disasters in our area,\" says Mr Mooney, mentioning storms and wildfires as examples. \"Whenever there's power outages in our community nearby, we're always fine,\" Ms Erickson adds. A 2,100 watt solar energy system is large enough to keep a small freezer, fridge, washing machine and laptops running, they say, adding that they hope to triple or quadruple their solar-generating capacity in the future. . During the winter, the pair rely on a small gas generator when there is too much cloud around. They document their experiences on a YouTube channel called . This Off Grid Life. . You might think that this approach is only suited to a handful of mavericks who dream of living by themselves in the forest. But climate change is making . extreme weather events more commonplace.  and prompting many people to reconsider the security of supply. With the cost of energy soaring in many parts of the world, thanks in part to the war in Ukraine, it's possible that more people will consider installing solar panels and battery systems to lower their costs - or even go off-grid entirely. Institutions and communities are already installing miniature power grids that can keep going after severe weather or other disasters have interrupted the main supply. It's called \"islanding\" or \"island mode\". When an extreme winter storm hit Texas in February 2021, the University of Texas at Austin relied on . its own energy sources and microgrid.  to avoid losing power, despite widespread blackouts nearby. . What if your local school could do this too? Or even your own house?. \"I think we are inching our way to the point where every neighbourhood could have a microgrid,\" says Katherine Hammack, director of special projects at Green Business Certification Inc. \"Climate change is driving people to look at alternate solutions.\". It is increasingly common in the US. Take the town of Fairfield in Connecticut, for instance. After Hurricane Irene in 2011, officials began looking for ways of ensuring that some essential services could continue to function in the event of a similar disaster. If the main grid fails, . the town now has a microgrid system. , including a gas generator and solar panels, which can provide power to the police and fire headquarters, a homeless shelter, emergency communications centre and a mobile phone mast. Some companies now manufacture miniature microgrid systems, ready to deploy during a crisis. . When Hurricane Maria slammed into Puerto Rico in 2017, cutting electricity supplies across the island, US firm BoxPower provided a solar panel and microgrid solution that comes packed in a shipping container. The technology was used to restore electricity supplies at two schools and a community centre. . The same kit is in place to this day and activates automatically whenever there is a problem with the main power grid. \"Those schools now never lose power,\" says BoxPower chief executive and founder Angelo Campus. BoxPower has since worked with utility companies in California to set up standalone grid systems for some remote communities. For example, the community of Briceburg used to receive electricity via long overhead power cables that ferried power from the main grid through forests and up hillsides. But this cabling was prone to damage from wildfires, explains Mr Campus. \"They replace [the cables] with an off-grid solar, battery and generator system which provides 100% of the power to that customer,\" he says. In other words, the community is now completely detached from the main grid. But in theory its power supply, being independent, ought to be much more stable than before. It is also greener, with 80%-90% of the electricity now coming from renewables. There are some examples of island-style microgrids in the UK, such as at the . Centre for Alternative Technology in Wales. , but they are rare, says Sara Walker, professor in energy at Newcastle University. . \"In practice, at the moment it's not allowed by the network operators because it means that that bit of network is potentially live at a time when they're doing repairs,\" she explains. Installing microgrids that can operate independently of the main grid also requires additional hardware and policies over when and how to detach from the main grid, adds Prof Hongjian Sun from Durham University, an engineer who specialises in energy grids and power supply. A spokesperson for the Energy Networks Association in the UK said the electricity grid here is more resilient than that in the US but that islanding does occur occasionally. . More technology of business:. BoxPower's Angelo Campus suggests that fully off-grid solutions might be best suited to remote households or small isolated communities, whereas in built-up urban areas it may be easier and cheaper to rely on a network of large batteries that could send power back to the main grid during a shortfall. . Whatever the exact solution, with climate change and geopolitics continuing to threaten the reliability of energy supplies we have for so long taken for granted, the lure of back-up infrastructure of one kind or another is arguably getting stronger by the day. The off-gridders certainly know where they stand. \"Everybody should have some sort of back-up to stay safe,\" says Ms Erickson. \"The world is changing,\" adds Mr Mooney, \"and we need to change with it.\" ."},

Roedd y Canghellor Kwasi Kwarteng eisoes wedi cyhoeddi y bydd y cynnydd o 1.25% mewn Yswiriant Gwladol, a gyflwynwyd fis Ebrill, yn cael ei wrthdroi.

Ond beth am y Cymry yn ehangach?. Cyn ei ddatganiad ddydd Gwener roedd y Canghellor Kwasi Kwarteng wedi dweud: \"Er mwyn codi safonau byw i bawb mae angen i ni fod yn ddiymddiheuriad am dyfu ein heconomi\" a bod \"trethu ein ffordd tuag at ffyniant erioed wedi gweithio\".

Ymysg y cyhoeddiadau oedd tynhau'r rheolau ar Gredyd Cynhwysol, dileu'r codiad treth ar alcohol a chael gwared ar y gyfradd uchaf o dreth incwm. Yn \u00f4l Llywodraeth y DU, fe fydd dros miliwn o bobl yng Nghymru yn elwa o'r penderfyniad i dorri'r brif gyfradd o dreth incwm o fis Ebrill nesaf, blwyddyn yn gynt na'r disgwyl. Mae'n \"agwedd newydd ar gyfer cyfnod newydd,\" dywedodd Mr Kwarteng. Ond fe honnodd ys AS Llafur Rachel Reeves, Canghellor yr wrthblaid, ei fod yn \"fwydlen heb brisiau\", ac fe feirniadodd y llywodraeth am beidio \u00e2 chyhoeddi asesiad annibynnol o gyflwr yr economi. Mae'r dreth ar brynu tai yn Lloegr hefyd yn cael ei thorri - dywedodd y Trysorlys y bydd \u00a370m yn ychwanegol yn mynd i goffrau Llywodraeth Cymru o ganlyniad. Fe fydd y sawl sy'n derbyn Credyd Cynhwysol ac sy'n gweithio llai na 15 awr yr wythnos yn wynebu toriad yn eu taliadau os nad ydyn nhw'n cymryd camau i ennill mwy. Mae dros 200,000 o deuluoedd yng Nghymru yn derbyn y credyd. Bydd mwy o help hefyd i bobl dros 50 oed i ddod o hyd i waith. Cyhoeddodd y Canghellor y bydd y gyfradd sylfaenol o dreth incwm yn gostwng i 19%, flwyddyn yn gynt na'r disgwyl. Rhyw 1.29m o bobl yng Nghymru sy'n talu'r gyfradd sylfaenol. Yn \u00f4l y Trysorlys, fe fydd rhain yn elwa o tua \u00a3170 ar gyfartaledd. Hefyd o fis Ebrill nesaf, fe fydd y gyfradd ychwanegol - sef 45% ar incwm dros \u00a3150,000 - yn diflannu. 9,000 o bobl yng Nghymru sy'n talu'r gyfradd yma. Yn Lloegr a Gogledd Iwerddon ni fydd yn rhaid talu treth ar brynu tai sydd werth llai na \u00a3250,000, yn hytrach na'r \u00a3125,000 presennol. Mae gan Gymru system debyg - y Dreth Trafodion Tir - gyda dim i'w dalu ar dai gwerth llai na \u00a3180,000. . Mae \u00a370m ar gael i Lywodraeth Cymru o ganlyniad i'r newid yn Lloegr, ond does dim rheidrwydd y bydd y gyfradd yn newid yn yr un ffordd. Mae'r codiad o 1.25% yn y bunt mewn Yswiriant Cenedlaethol a gyflwynwyd gan Boris Johnson wedi'i ddileu. Ond dywedodd Mr Kwarteng y byddai'r Gwasanaeth Iechyd a gofal cymdeithasol yn Lloegr yn parhau i gael eu hariannu i'r un lefel. Yng Nghymru fe fydd dwy filiwn o bobl yn talu llai o Yswiriant Cenedlaethol - tua \u00a3235 ar gyfartaledd. Mae'r Canghellor yn dileu'r cynllun i godi'r dreth gorfforaethol o 19% i 25%, a'r cynllun i godi'r dreth ar gwrw, seidr, gwin a gwirodydd. Dywedodd Mr Kwarteng y byddai'n \"edrych i weithio\" gyda Llywodraeth Cymru i greu parthau buddsoddi newydd. Mae'r parthau newydd yn Lloegr yn cynnig toriad treth er mwyn i fusnesau fuddsoddi, a llacio cyfyngiadau cynllunio. Llywodraeth Cymru sy'n gyfrifol am bolisi cynllunio yng Nghymru. Dywedodd Ysgrifennydd Cymru, Syr Robert Buckland: \"Mae'r mesurau blaengar yma heddiw yn rhoi twf economaidd wrth galon ein cynlluniau... economi sy'n tyfu yw'r ateb tymor hir gorau i'r pwysau ariannol enbyd sy'n ein hwynebu ni oll.\". Ond yn \u00f4l Gweinidog Cyllid Llywodraeth Cymru, Rebecca Evans mae Llywodraeth y DU yn \"mynd i gyfeiriad wirioneddol bryderus gyda blaenoriaethau cyfeiliornus... a fydd yn plannu annhegwch\". \"Yn hytrach na chefnogaeth ystyrlon, wedi'i thargedu i'r rhai sydd angen help fwyaf, mae'r Canghellor yn blaenoriaethu ariannu toriadau trethi i'r cyfoethog, taliadau bonws di-ben-draw i'r bancwyr ac amddiffyn elw'r cwmn\u00efau ynni,\" meddai. Mae hi hefyd yn beirniadu \"cyfle a gollwyd\" i fuddsoddi mewn cynlluniau ynni gwyrdd a fyddai'n \"gwella ein diogelwch ynni yn y tymor hir a helpu atal y math yma o argyfwng [costau byw] rhag digwydd eto\". Dywedodd Ben Lake AS, llefarydd Plaid Cymru ar y Trysorlys: \"Datganiad i gefnogi'r bobl fwyaf cyfoethog gawson ni gan y Canghellor heddiw. . \"Mae aelwydydd a busnesau ledled Cymru yn wynebu gaeaf difrifol o filiau anfforddiadwy a chwyddiant cynyddol, ac ymateb y llywodraeth yw i blesio'r cyfoethog iawn gyda ffantasi llwyr.\". Ond fe fynnodd arweinydd y Ceidwadwyr Cymreig yn y Senedd, Andrew RT Davies \"ni allwch drethu eich ffordd i ffyniant\", gan ganmol \"cynllun blaengar i dyfu ein heconomi, hybu swyddi a chynyddu cyflogau\". . Mewn cyfnod pan fod pobl yn ei chael hi'n anodd dygymod \u00e2 chostau byw, mae'n \"hanfodol\", meddai, \"eu bod yn gallu cadw mwy o'u harian eu hunain\".

O ganlyniad i'r cynllun bydd prisiau ynni cyfanwerthol ar gyfer pob cwmni yn cael eu capio am gyfnod o chwe mis. O 1 Hydref bydd ysbytai, ysgolion a lleoliadau eraill fel neuaddau cymunedol ac eglwysi hefyd yn derbyn y gefnogaeth, gyda phrif weinidog y DU yn dweud y bydd yn \"cynnig sicrwydd a thawelwch meddwl\". Daw'r ymyrraeth bellach yn y farchnad ynni wedi i'r llywodraeth gyhoeddi cynllun gwerth \u00a3150bn i helpu cartrefi gyda'u biliau am gyfnod o ddwy flynedd. Dywedodd Ffederasiwn Busnesau Bach (FSB) Cymru bod ei haelodau wedi gweld cyfnod \"hynod o anodd\" o gostau cynyddol. Yn \u00f4l cadeirydd polisi y ffederasiwn, Ben Francis, bydd y cyhoeddiad yn galluogi busnesau i gynllunio tuag at gyfnod y Nadolig. \"Mae'n werth cofio nad yw aelodau Ffederasiwn Busnesau Bach Cymru yn gorfforaethau rhyngwladol. Nid ydynt yn fusnesau FTSE 100,\" meddai. \"Busnesau bach yw'r rhain, sy'n eiddo i bobl arferol gyda morgeisi i'w talu, teulu i'w bwydo ac, ar y gorwel, Nadolig i gynllunio ar ei gyfer. \"Maen nhw wedi crafangu eu ffordd trwy bandemig Covid-19. Nawr, o'r ochr arall, maent wedi cael y cynnydd digynsail hwn mewn costau ynni.\". Dywedodd Mr Francis fod y gost gynyddol o wneud busnes yn golygu bod y sefyllfa sy'n wynebu ei aelodau yn \"hynod o anodd\". Ychwanegodd bod y cyhoeddiad ddydd Mercher yn rhoi \"rhyw fath o sicrwydd\". \"Mae'n caniat\u00e1u i'r busnesau hyn gynllunio tuag at gyfnod y Nadolig,\" meddai. \"Rydym yn croesawu'r ffaith y bydd adolygiad ar \u00f4l tri mis, a fydd yn galluogi pob parti i bwyso a mesur y sefyllfa a pha mor effeithiol fu'r pecyn cymorth, gyda'r bwriad o'i ymestyn o bosib.\". Dyw swyddogion heb gyhoeddi cost y cymorth \u200b\u200bdiweddaraf i gwmn\u00efau, gan y bydd y gost yn y pendraw yn dibynnu ar yr hyn sy'n digwydd i bris y farchnad gyfanwerthol rhwng mis Hydref a mis Ebrill, pan ddaw'r cymorth presennol i ben. O dan y cynllun, a gyhoeddwyd gan yr Adran Busnes, Ynni a Diwydiant, bydd prisiau cyfanwerthol yn sefydlog ar gyfer pob cwsmer ynni annomestig, sef \u00a3211 fesul MWh o drydan a \u00a375 fesul MWh o nwy. Nid oes angen i gwmn\u00efau gysylltu \u00e2'u cyflenwyr gan y bydd hyn yn cael ei wneud iddynt yn awtomatig. Yn \u00f4l Llywodraeth y DU bydd y pris yn \"llai na hanner y prisiau cyfanwerthu a ragwelir y gaeaf hwn\", gan ychwanegu y bydd yr arbedion i'w gweld ym miliau mis Hydref ymlaen. Dywedodd Prif Weinidog y DU, Liz Truss, fod y llywodraeth yn deall y \"pwysau enfawr y mae busnesau, elusennau a sefydliadau sector cyhoeddus yn eu hwynebu gyda'u biliau ynni\". \"Fel yr ydym yn ei wneud i ddefnyddwyr domestig, bydd ein cynllun newydd yn cadw eu biliau ynni i lawr o fis Hydref, gan gynnig sicrwydd a thawelwch meddwl,\" meddai. \"Ar yr un pryd, rydyn ni'n rhoi hwb i'r cyflenwad ynni sy'n cael ei gynhyrchu ym Mhrydain fel y gallwn drwsio gwraidd y problemau rydyn ni'n eu hwynebu, gan olygu mwy o sicrwydd ynni i ni oll.\". Yn y cyfamser mae Plaid Cymru wedi galw am dreth untro ar gwmn\u00efau olew a nwy, gan ddweud y dylai'r arian hwnnw fynd tuag at insiwleiddio . Ychwanegodd eu harweinydd yn San Steffan, Liz Saville Roberts, y gallai buddsoddiad o \u00a33.6bn arbed \u00a3418 y flwyddyn ar filiau ynni cartrefi, a chynnig \"hwb i'r diwydiant adeiladu a'r economi ehangach\". \"Bydd gwrthod buddsoddi mewn insiwleiddio r\u0175an yn cloi cartrefi i mewn i ddegawdau o dlodi tra bod cwmn\u00efau tanwydd ffosil yn gwneud elw grot\u00e9sg,\" meddai. \"Rydym felly'n annog Liz Truss i gymryd y cynigion hyn o ddifrif.\". Dywedodd AS Ceidwadol Brycheiniog a Maesyfed, Fay Jones y dylai'r llywodraeth fod wedi gwneud y cyhoeddiad ar lawr T\u0177'r Cyffredin er mwyn iddyn nhw allu \"craffu\" ar y manylion. Ychwanegodd bod y llywodraeth eisoes wedi cynnig \u00a3400 i bob cartref yn gynharach eleni er mwyn helpu gyda chostau biliau, ond bod pryderon pellach am yr effaith ar gymunedau gwledig y gaeaf hwn. \"Dydy tua dau draean o fy etholwyr ddim ar y grid,\" meddai. \"Dwi'n gwybod nad yw e . j. u. st . yn broblem am brisiau, mae am argaeledd hefyd. \"Dwi'n gwybod fod pobl yn ffonio cwmn\u00efau olew, yn trio archebu llwyth ond methu cytuno ar bris achos mae hynny bythefnos o flaen llaw.\". Ychwanegodd Andrew Morgan, arweinydd Cyngor Rhondda Cynon Taf a Chymdeithas Llywodraeth Leol Cymru, fod bil ynni Llywodraeth y DU \"ddim yn agos at fod yn ddigon\" i helpu cynghorau. \"Gallai costau ynni i awdurdodau lleol gynyddu hyd at 285%, felly dyw gostyngiad o 50% ddim yn agos at fod yn ddigon ac mae'r gefnogaeth honno ond am chwe mis,\" meddai. Daeth ei sylwadau'n dilyn rhybudd ym mis Awst y gallai cynnydd yng nghostau ynni effeithio ar allu cynghorau i ddarparu gwasanaethau yn y dyfodol."},

{"a": "Mae tua 60 o bobl wedi bod mewn protest yn Aberystwyth yn erbyn penderfyniad i ddod \u00e2 rhaglen radio i ben. Cyhoeddwyd fis diwethaf mai Caryl Parry Jones fydd cyflwynydd newydd slot rhaglen Geraint Lloyd ar BBC Radio Cymru. Mae Geraint Lloyd wedi bod yn darlledu ar Radio Cymru ers chwarter canrif, gan gynnwys y rhaglen hwyr ers 2012. Ond mae'r penderfyniad wedi cythruddo rhai o wrandawyr cyson y rhaglen.

Roedd Microsoft \"yn araf iawn yn cyflwyno swyddogaethau dwyieithog i'w meddalwedd Teams\" yn \u00f4l prif weithredwr a chlerc y Senedd, Manon Antoniazzi. Dywedodd Microsoft bod Teams, ers haf eleni, yn galluogi cyfieithu ar y pryd ar gyfer cyfarfodydd. Mae ystadegau'r Senedd ar y defnydd o'r Gymraeg mewn trafodion yn dangos cynnydd yng nghanran y cyfraniadau yn yr iaith ers dechrau pandemig y coronafeirws. Cyfarfod rhithwir y Senedd ar Zoom ar 1 Ebrill 2020 oedd y cyntaf o'i fath yn y DU, ac mae'r cyfarfodydd llawn a phwyllgorau yn parhau ar ffurf hybrid gyda rhai Aelodau yn y Senedd ac eraill yn ymuno drwy gyswllt fideo. Eglurodd Manon Antoniazzi, \"roedd llawer o reolau a rheoliadau a phrotocolau yr oedd yn rhaid eu gosod o'r neilltu oherwydd bod angen i ni ddal ati\". . \"Roedd yn rhaid i ni godi materion mor uchel ag y gallem gyda Microsoft, ond roeddent yn araf iawn yn cyflwyno swyddogaethau dwyieithog i'w meddalwedd Teams. . \"Felly er na chafodd ei gymeradwyo mewn gwirionedd gan y Ganolfan Seiberddiogelwch Genedlaethol ar y pryd i ddefnyddio Zoom, oherwydd ei fod yn rhywbeth a oedd yn cael ei brif ffrydio'n sydyn, cynigiodd Zoom y swyddogaeth ddwyieithog honno inni. . \"Felly neidion ni'n syth i mewn.\". Derbyniodd Zoom ardystiad \"hanfodion seiber\" y Ganolfan Seiberddiogelwch Genedlaethol (NCSC) ym mis Chwefror eleni. Nid yw'r ganolfan - sy'n rhan o Bencadlys Cyfathrebu Llywodraeth y DU (GCHQ) - yn rheoleiddiwr ond mae'n darparu cyngor seiberddiogelwch. Mae'r cynllun ardystio gan y ganolfan yn helpu sefydliadau i ddangos i gwsmeriaid presennol a darpar gwsmeriaid bod eu diogelwch yn amddiffyn rhag y bygythiadau seiber mwyaf cyffredin. .

O ganlyniad, dywed y comisiwn y bydd yn \"ystyried sut y gellir cefnogi Aelodau i barhau i ddefnyddio'u sgiliau Cymraeg yn hyderus mewn cyfarfodydd a digwyddiadau ar yr yst\u00e2d\" ac \"edrych ar ffyrdd o ddarparu cyfarpar a thechnoleg cyfieithu ar y pryd sy'n fwy hylaw a hwylus i'w defnyddio\". .

Symudodd y Senedd yn ddiweddarach i fformat hybrid, lle gallai aelodau fod yn bresennol mewn niferoedd cyfyngedig. Ar \u00f4l cyfnod byr pan ddychwelodd trafodion rhithwir y gaeaf diwethaf, cafodd cyfyngiadau eu lleddfu ar faint o wleidyddion all fynd i'r siambr. Ers 1 Mawrth eleni mae pob un o'r 60 aelod yn cael mynychu'r siambr os ydyn nhw'n dymuno. Roedd disgwyl i weithio a phleidleisio o bell ddod i ben ar \u00f4l yr haf, ond wedi adolygiad fe wnaeth uwch aelodau'r Senedd ar y pwyllgor busnes trawsbleidiol gynnig caniat\u00e1u i Aelodau barhau i ymuno \u00e2'r cyfarfodydd llawn a phwyllgorau o bell.

Daeth sesiynau hybrid yn Nh\u0177'r Cyffredin i ben yn haf 2021. Dywed Senedd Cymru eu bod, ers dechrau'r pandemig, wedi cynghori nifer o seneddau, cyrff cyhoeddus ac awdurdodau lleol ar gynnal cyfarfodydd rhithwir gan ddefnyddio cyfieithu ar y pryd. ."},

Ar hyn o bryd mae awdurdodau lleol yn ystyried pa ardaloedd fydd yn cael eu cynnwys fel rhan o gam dau, a bydd teuluoedd cymwys yn cael gwybod am hynny yn y flwyddyn newydd.

Un peth mae'r plant yn siomedig yn ei gylch yw bod eu gwersi Hebraeg yn y synagog yng Nghaerdydd wedi dod i ben. \"Roedden ni arfer mynd i'r synagog i ddysgu Hebraeg ond nawr gan nad oes digon o niferoedd plant naethon nhw stopio ym mis Medi a heb ail-gychwyn.

Maen nhw'n rhybuddio bod dim modd diystyru colli swyddi mewn cynghorau na thoriadau i wasanaethau. \"Does dim modd gorbwysleisio maint yr her sy'n wynebu cynghorau\", meddai'r gymdeithas. . Mae cynllun i . gefnogi y sector cyhoeddus a busnesau.  wedi ei gyhoeddi gan Lywodraeth y DU, a dywedodd llefarydd: \"Mi fyddwn yn cyhoeddi adolygiad i'r ffordd mae'r cynllun yn gweithio mewn tri mis i wneud penderfyniadau am gefnogaeth bellach ar \u00f4l mis Mawrth 2023.\". Pan fu Cyngor Sir Penfro yn wynebu pwysau ar eu cyllideb wyth mlynedd yn \u00f4l, cafodd y pwll nofio yn Arberth ei drosglwyddo i'r gymuned leol. Ers hynny maen nhw wedi mynd o nerth i nerth, gyda channoedd o bobl yn gwneud defnydd ohono bob wythnos. Ond yn \u00f4l Martin James, un o ymddiriedolwyr y pwll, mae cynnydd mewn costau yn golygu eu bod nhw bellach yn poeni am y dyfodol. \"Mae'r costau ynni wedi saethu i fyny'n ddiweddar, mae costau clorin wedi codi,\" meddai. \"Mae'n anodd iawn, felly rydyn ni'n eithaf pryderus am ddyfodol y pwll ac a fyddwn ni'n gallu aros ar agor ai peidio.\". Nid gwasanaethau sy'n eiddo i'r gymuned yn unig sy'n wynebu heriau. Yn \u00f4l y cyngor, ysgolion a chanolfannau hamdden sy'n defnyddio y mwyaf o ynni.  . Mae gan Sir Benfro, fel nifer o gynghorau, gytundeb ynni sefydlog tan fis Ebrill y flwyddyn nesaf, felly y gwir bryder yw beth sy'n digwydd ar \u00f4l hynny. Maen nhw'n dweud y gallai biliau ddyblu pan fydd cytundebau'n cael eu hadnewyddu. Yn Ysgol Gymunedol Aberdaugleddau, mae'r pennaeth dros dro, Nick Dyer, yn paratoi am gyfnod anodd. \"Rwy'n credu ein bod yn paratoi ein hunain ar gyfer storm ar y gorwel, efallai nad yw'n bwrw glaw eto ond rydym yn disgwyl iddi wneud,\" meddai. Dywedodd fod cyllidebau ysgolion eleni wedi ystyried y cynnydd mewn costau ynni, ond y gallai'r cynnydd mewn biliau y flwyddyn nesaf effeithio ar adnoddau a swyddi. \"Beth ydyn ni ddim yn gwybod yw beth fydd yn digwydd ar \u00f4l Ebrill 2023, ond yn barod ry'n ni'n edrych arno ac yn meddwl y gallai fod yna gynnydd o 100% neu fwy mewn costau. \"Os nad yw ysgolion yn cael eu hariannu ar gyfer hynny fe fyddwn ni wir yn ei chael hi'n anodd... a chi'n dechrau siarad wedyn am gyflogau ac adnoddau i blant.\". Mae tua thri chwarter y plant yn ysgol Mr Dyer yn byw mewn tlodi ac felly maen nhw eisioes yn cadw llygad barcud ar ddarparu cefnogaeth lles ychwanegol i'r teuluoedd hynny sy'n ei chael hi'n anodd. Y pwysau ar gyllideb cartrefi fydd yn cael yr effaith fwyaf ar yr hyn mae'r ysgol yn ei ddarparu, meddai: \"Beth ni'n gwybod yw pan mae costau yn mynd lan mae straen yn mynd lan i deuluoedd, a phan mae straen yn mynd lan mewn teuluoedd mae'r angen i ysgolion roi cefnogaeth.\". Mae hynny yn golygu y byddan nhw angen mwy o staff i gysylltu \u00e2 gwasanaethau cymdeithasol.  Ond fe allai pwysau ar eu cyllideb olygu y bydd yn rhaid iddyn nhw wneud mwy gyda llai o arian y flwyddyn nesaf.\". Mae'r un peth yn wir am yr awdurdod lleol yn ei gyfanrwydd. . \"Pan mae amseroedd yn mynd yn anoddach mae'r galw yn codi\", meddai Dirprwy Arweinydd Cyngor Sir Penfro, y Cynghorydd Paul Miller. Mae gwasanaethau cymdeithasol, gwasanaethau digartrefedd, gwasanaethau teuluol ac ysgolion i gyd yn gweld cynnydd yn y galw mewn hinsawdd economaidd anodd. \"Mae'n eithaf difrifol. Rydyn ni'n siarad am bwysau o \u00a35m eleni. A'r flwyddyn nesaf ni'n amcangyfri ein bod ni'n edrych ar tua \u00a318.5m o ddiffyg.\". Mae'n ofyniad statudol ar awdurdodau lleol i gydbwyso eu llyfrau, ac felly mae diffygion yn anochel yn golygu toriadau i wasanaethau. Yn \u00f4l y Cynghorydd Millar, allan nhw ddim diystyru colli swyddi: \"Costau staff yw cyfran sylweddol o'n costau ac felly dydyn ni ddim mewn sefyllfa lle gallwn ddiystyru [colli swyddi].\". Mae Cymdeithas Llywodraeth Leol Cymru'n dweud nad Sir Benfro yn unig sydd \u00e2 phryderon fel hyn ac mae cynghorau Cymru'n wynebu diffyg o \u00a3200m yn eu cyllidebau y flwyddyn nesaf. Yr wythnos hon, fe gyhoeddodd Llywodraeth y DU gynllun fyddai'n . torri biliau ynni i gynghorau a busnesau.  am chwe mis. Ond \"ni ellir gorbwysleisio maint yr her\" wrth i awdurdodau lleol wynebu cynnydd o hyd at 285% mewn costau ynni, meddai'r Cynghorydd Anthony Hunt o Dorfaen, llefarydd cyllid Cymdeithas Llywodraeth Leol Cymru. \"Mae gwasanaethau lleol yn wynebu cynnydd o hyd at 285% mewn costau ynni, sy'n golygu y bydd angen llawer mwy o gefnogaeth gan Lywodraeth y DU i ateb y pwysau eithriadol.\". Yn \u00f4l llefarydd ar ran Llywodraeth y DU: \"Rydym yn deall y pwysau mae busnesau, elusennau a'r sector cyhoeddus yn wynebu gyda'u biliau ynni a dyna pam mae Llywodraeth y DU wedi gweithredu ar unwaith i sicrhau bod cwsmeriaid wedi eu hamddiffyn dros gyfnod y gaeaf. . \"Mi fyddwn yn cyhoeddi adolygiad i'r ffordd mae'r cynllun yn gweithio mewn tri mis i helpu wneud penderfyniadau am gefnogaeth bellach ar \u00f4l Mawrth 2023.\"."},

Roedd 60% yn credu y dylai cyllid cyhoeddus ond gael ei gynnig i ffermydd sy'n \"weithgar dros ddiogelu natur a'r hinsawdd\". Mae ffermydd Cymru'n rhannu cyfanswm o dros \u00a3300m mewn cymorthdaliadau yn flynyddol ar hyn o bryd, gyda'r rhan helaeth o hwnnw'n cael ei ddosbarthu ar sail faint o dir sy' dan eu gofal. Mae cynllun cymhorthdal Cymreig newydd, i ddisodli taliadau'r Undeb Ewropeaidd, wedi bod yn cael ei ddatblygu ers pleidlais Brexit, gyda'r bwriad o'i gyflwyno'n raddol o 2025 ymlaen. Cafodd cynllun drafft ei gyhoeddi ym mis Gorffennaf, tra bod y Mesur Amaeth (Cymru) - fydd yn galluogi gweinidogion i weinyddu'r newidiadau - yn mynd gerbron y Senedd ddydd Llun. Mae Llywodraeth Cymru yn gweld ffermwyr yn ganolog i'w chynlluniau ar gyfer helpu taclo newid hinsawdd a'r colledion ym myd natur, o gofio eu bod yn rheoli dros 80% o dirwedd y wlad. Ond mae'r newidiadau arfaethedig ymysg y mwyaf pellgyrhaeddol i'r diwydiant mewn cenhedlaeth ac wedi arwain at lot o drafod a dadlau - yn enwedig o ystyried pwysigrwydd amaeth i economi a diwylliant cefn gwlad. Dywedodd Rhian Brewster, pennaeth cyfathrebu WWF Cymru bod canlyniadau'r arolwg yn dod \"yn ystod moment allweddol i Gymru\" ac yn cynnig cipolwg o'r farn mewn cymunedau gwledig. \"Mae'r Bil Amaeth yn rhoi cyfle unwaith mewn cenhedlaeth i ni osod Cymru ar lwybr tuag at ddyfodol mwy cynaliadwy,\" meddai. \"Ry'n ni - ynghyd \u00e2'r mwyafrif o Gymru wledig - yn awyddus i weld ffermwyr yn cael eu gwobrwyo am fabwysiadu arferion adfywiol sy'n gyfeillgar i'r hinsawdd a natur. Gall y trawsnewidiad hollbwysig yma ond ddigwydd gyda newidiadau uchelgeisiol i daliadau amaethyddol.\". '. Mor bwysig \u00e2 Bil Amaeth 1947. '. Tra'n gefnogol i nifer o agweddau o'r ad-drefnu, mae undebau amaeth wedi dadlau y dylai'r problemau diweddar sydd wedi'u hachosi i gyflenwadau bwyd yn sgil y pandemig a rhyfel Wcr\u00e1in arwain at ailfeddwl. Mae NFU Cymru am weld y mesur yn cynnwys \"mecanweithiau fydd yn sicrhau bod lefelau cynhyrchu bwyd domestig yn cael eu hasesu, parhau a chryfhau\" ar y cyd ag ymrwymiadau ar newid hinsawdd a bioamrywiaeth. Dywedodd llywydd yr undeb, Aled Jones fod \"ei galon yn torri o feddwl am bobl yn diodde' ar incwm isel, yn trio bwydo eu teuluoedd - ac os yw bwyd yn mynd yn fwy a mwy drud yna fe fydd hi'n anodd iawn arnyn nhw\". Disgrifiodd cyhoeddi Mesur Amaeth i Gymru fel moment oedd \"cyn bwysiced\" \u00e2 Bil Amaeth 1947, a basiwyd gan D\u0177'r Cyffredin er mwyn annog cynhyrchu bwyd yn dilyn yr Ail Ryfel Byd. \"Ar hyn o bryd mae'n hanfodol bwysig i ni fel gwlad i sicrhau ein bod ni'n parhau i gynnal ein gallu i gynhyrchu bwyd,\" meddai. \"A hefyd wrth gofio bod y dulliau cynhyrchu sydd yn cael eu defnyddio yma yng Nghymru ymhlith y rhai mwyaf cefnogol o ran newid hinsawdd.\". Dywedodd Llywodraeth Cymru ei bod wedi cyhoeddi ei chynlluniau ar gyfer y Cynllun Ffermio Cynaliadwy fis Gorffennaf gyda'r bwriad i annog ffermio cynaliadwy a chynhyrchu bwyd mewn modd sy'n cyd-fynd \u00e2'r amgylchedd. \"Mae ymateb i'r argyfwng hinsawdd a natur yn hanfodol ar gyfer dyfodol ein diwydiant ffermio, rydyn yn gweithio gyda'r diwydiant i sicrhau bod ein cynlluniau ar gyfer y dyfodol yn cadw ffermwyr ar y tir i gynhyrchu bwyd yn gynaliadwy ac amddiffyn ein cymunedau gwledig,\" meddai llefarydd."},

Roghnaich i a h-ainm fh\u00e8in a chumail - rud a chuir cais air cuid an Alba, 's i air a' chiad bh\u00e0nrigh den ainm sin a bhith a' riaghladh air Alba. B' e a' chiad sheirbheis chr\u00f9naidh riamh a chaidh a chraoladh air an telebhisean - ach a-mh\u00e0in an t-ungadh agus an comannachadh - le tomhas gun robh 277 millean duine air feadh an t-saoghail ga choimhead. B' e cuideachd a' chiad tachartas m\u00f2r eadar-n\u00e0iseanta a chaidh a chraoladh gu h-eadar-n\u00e0iseanta air an telebhisean. Bha ceist mu bhith a' ceadachadh chamarathan am broinn na h-Abaid, ach dh'iarr a' Bhanrigh fh\u00e8in gun tachradh sin, a dh'aindeoin 's gun robh am Pr\u00ecomhaire, Winston Churchill, na aghaidh. B' e seo a' chiad annas a thachair agus Ealasaid na b\u00e0n-righ, le iomadh atharrachadh agus leasachadh teicne\u00f2lais a' tighinn eadar seo agus deireadh a beatha, a thug cruth-atharrachadh air beatha mhic-an-duine air feadh an t-saoghail. Anns na bliadhnaichean an d\u00e8idh a cr\u00f9naidh, chaidh neo-eisimeileachd a thoirt do na d\u00f9thchannan mu dheireadh a bh' air a bhith nam p\u00e0irt de dh'\u00ccmpireachd Bhreatainn - \u00ccmpireachd cho m\u00f2r 's a bh' ann riamh. Dh'atharraich sin seasamh Bhreatainn mar dh\u00f9thaich, agus an sealladh a bh' aig a muinntir orra fh\u00e8in. Dh'atharraich ce\u00f2l agus cultar na d\u00f9thcha gu m\u00f2r, a thuilleadh air siostam an airgid ann an 1971, agus an eaconomaidh gu l\u00e8ir ag atharrachadh le lorg na h-ola sa Chuan a Tuath sna '70an, agus fuasgladh air riaghailtean nan seirbheisean ionmhais anns na 1980an. . Ann an 1973, ghabh Breatainn dhan Mhargaidh Choitchinn E\u00f2rpaich (\u00e0s an do dh'\u00e8irich an t-Aonadh E\u00f2rpach). . Dh'atharraich sin mar a bha Breatainn ga faicinn fh\u00e8in san t-saoghal cuideachd. Mus robh beatha Ealasaid seachad ge-t\u00e0, bh\u00f2t muinntir na d\u00f9thcha gus an EU fh\u00e0gail.

{"a": "Almost five years after she took her own life, the inquest into the death of teenager Molly Russell is due to begin. Molly, 14, killed herself in 2017 after viewing material about self-harm, suicide and depression, on social media sites such as Instagram and Pinterest. Her father Ian, a campaigner for online safety, hopes it is a turning point. \"I hope that we will learn lessons and that it will help produce the change that's needed to keep people safe, to keep people alive,\" he told BBC News. Mr Russell,  from Harrow, north-west London, believes long-term exposure to harmful material contributed to Molly's death. Molly's story provided fresh impetus for new legislation to regulate so-called big tech companies. The Online Safety Bill is still making its way through Parliament and is due a third reading in the Commons. . Meta, which owns Instagram, and Pinterest are officially taking part in the inquest, which is due to last two weeks. It will hear evidence from executives from both companies, after they were ordered by the coroner to appear in person. Meta is likely to be questioned about a number of internal documents revealed by the former employee and whistleblower Frances Haugen. These include research carried out by the company into the impact of the platform on the mental health of young people. In the last six months of her life, Molly used her Instagram account up to 120 times a day, liking more than 11,000 pieces of content. She is thought to have used the image-sharing site Pinterest more than 15,000 times over the same period. The coroner, Andrew Walker, has already been warned that some of the content is \"pretty dreadful\" and difficult even for adults to look at for extended periods of time. Ged Flynn, chief executive of Papyrus, which works to prevent suicide in young people, said Mr Russell's campaign to prevent future deaths was \"a hugely significant contribution to the agenda of suicide prevention in this country\". \"We have to change the way we accept the power of the tech giants,\" he said. Others believe that the inquest may prove to be a \"watershed moment\". Andy Burrows, head of child safety online policy at the NSPCC, said: \"Molly's death is a tragedy that is all too relatable to all parents who worry about the risks their children face online. \"For the first time we will see big tech representatives questioned under oath about how their products may have contributed to the death of a child.\". A Meta spokesperson told the BBC: \"Our deepest sympathies remain with Molly's family and we will continue to assist the coroner in this inquest. We have never allowed content that promotes or glorifies suicide and self-harm.\". In a statement, Pinterest told BBC News: \"Combating self-harm is a priority for us as we strive to ensure that Pinterest plays a positive role in people's lives.\". However, Matthew Bergman, a lawyer from the Social Media Victims Law Centre, in Seattle, in the US, says the proceedings will be closely watched in North America. \"Regardless of the outcome, the fact that Meta senior personnel have been forced to testify in a proceeding like this one is a significant step toward accountability.\"."},

The leaked content was posted on Sunday after what is being described as one of gaming's biggest security breaches. . Rockstar Games said it remained unclear how the \"network intrusion\" occurred, but confirmed \"early development footage\" from GTA VI had been stolen. . The footage was put on the GTAForums site by a user called teapotuberhacker. . The hacker claimed to have gained access to the data by breaching Rockstar's internal feed on the Slack messaging app, and invited executives to negotiate to avoid further leaks. . Additional revelations could include source code, assets, and testing builds from both GTA 5 and GTA 6, which could be damaging to the company's operations. . While the original post has since been removed by moderators, it has been spread widely on social media. Rockstar has reportedly issued takedown orders to remove the footage from YouTube and Twitter. . The footage showed animation tests, level layouts and some gameplay demonstrations, and it appeared to confirm a long-running rumour that the game will feature the series' first playable female protagonist. . They also revealed the game's setting in a fictionalised version of Miami which was also the setting on 2002's GTA: Vice City. . In a statement on Monday, the company said it was \"extremely disappointed to have any details of our next game shared with you all in this way\". . \"Our work on the next Grand Theft Auto game will continue as planned and we remain as committed as ever to delivering an experience to you, our players, that truly exceeds your expectations,\" it added. . Rockstar confirmed it was . developing the game earlier this year,.  with industry insiders anticipating a 2024 or 2025 release date. . Some fans had speculated that the leak could see the game's release delayed, but executives said they did not anticipate \"any long-term effect on the development of our ongoing projects\". GTA 5 has sold more than 170 million copies since its release in 2013, making it one of the most successful video games of all time. .

In a statement posted to Twitter. , Twitch said: \"While we prohibit sharing links or referral codes to all sites that include slots, roulette or dice games, we've seen some people circumvent those rules and expose our community to potential harm.\". Stake.com, Rollbit.com, Duelbits.com, and Roobet.com would be banned - and it may exclude others in the future. But it would not ban sports betting, fantasy sports such as fantasy football, or poker.

He has yet to respond to Twitch's announcement. Gambling videos have proved contentious on Twitch since they first appeared - but in recent months, prominent streamers have been vocally critical, with some even threatening to organise a strike.

{"a": "Women are facing threats and blackmail from a mob of anonymous strangers after their personal details, intimate photos and videos were shared on the social media platform Reddit. The BBC has unmasked the man behind one of the groups, thanks to a second-hand cigarette lighter. \"\u00a35 for her nudes, DM me.\". \"I've got some of her vids looking to trade.\" . \"What are we gonna do to her?\". I felt sick as I scrolled through the images and comments online. There were thousands of photographs. A seemingly endless stream of naked or partially dressed women. Underneath, men were posting vicious commentary about the women, including rape threats. Much of what I saw was too explicit to share here. A tip-off from a friend had brought me to these images. One of her pictures had been lifted from Instagram and posted on Reddit. It was not a nude but was still accompanied by sexual and degrading language. She was concerned for herself and other women. What I found was a marketplace. Hundreds of anonymous profiles were dedicated to sharing, trading and selling explicit images - and it all appeared to be without the permission of the women pictured. It seemed like a new evolution of so-called revenge porn, where private sexual material is published online without consent, often by embittered ex-partners. . Not only were these intimate images being shared for an audience of thousands, but men - lurking behind the mask of anonymity - were teaming up to expose the real-life identities of these women, a practice known as doxing. . Addresses, phone numbers and social media handles were being swapped online - the women then being targeted with lurid sexual comments, threats and blackmail. . It felt like I had stumbled into a very dark corner of the internet, but this was all happening on a major social media platform. Reddit brands itself as \"the front page of the internet\". It has built an audience of about 50 million daily users - roughly four million in the UK - by letting people set up and run forums, known as \"subreddits\", dedicated to all kinds of interests. Most subreddits are harmless, but Reddit has a history of hosting controversial sexual content. In 2014, a huge cache of private images of celebrities was shared on the site, and four years later Reddit shut down a group which was using \"deepfake\" technology - a kind of artificial intelligence - to superimpose celebrities into porn videos. Responding to these controversies, the US-based company introduced stricter rules and strengthened its ban on posting or threatening to post intimate or sexually explicit media of people without their consent. I wanted to understand how women's intimate photographs were still being shared on Reddit and what it was like for those affected. . Then I wanted to find out who was behind it. I could see that Reddit's ban wasn't working. We found dozens of subreddits dedicated to sharing intimate images of women from all over the UK. The first one I looked at was focused on South Asian women and had more than 20,000 users, most of whom seemed to be men from the same community, with comments in English, Hindi, Urdu and Punjabi. Some of the women I recognised because they had large social media followings. A few I even knew personally. There were more than 15,000 images. We looked at a thousand of them and found sexually explicit pictures of 150 different women. All were being dehumanised as sexual objects in the comments. I was sure none of the women would have consented to appearing on this forum. Some, like the one my friend discovered of herself, were images lifted from the women's social media and weren't explicit. But they were accompanied by degrading comments and sometimes requests to hack victims' phones and computers for nudes. One woman we contacted says she now gets intrusive, sexual messages on social media \"every day\" after the group posted an image of her in a crop top from Instagram, alongside comments about raping her. The men on the subreddit were also sharing and selling naked photos of the women. These images looked like selfies which had been sent between partners and were not meant for public consumption. There were also videos - even more graphic - where it appeared as though the women had been secretly filmed during sex. One thread of messages featured images of a naked woman giving oral sex. . \"Anyone got any vids of this [expletive]?\" an anonymous user asked, using a derogatory name for her. \"I have her whole folder for \u00a35, snap me,\" another said. \"What's her socials,\" asked a third. Ayesha - not her real name - discovered videos of her were being shared on the subreddit last year. She believes she had been secretly filmed by an ex-partner. She didn't just have to deal with the violation of her trust, she also faced a wave of harassment and threats on social media when her personal details were posted on the forum. \"If you don't have sex with me, I'll send it to your parents. I will come and find you\u2026 If you don't agree to having sex with me, I will rape you.\" Her harassers tried to blackmail her for more images as well. \"Being a Pakistani girl, it's not right in our community for us to even get sexual before marriage or anything like that - that's not acceptable,\" she says. Ayesha stopped socialising or even leaving the house, and eventually tried to take her own life. After her suicide attempt, she had to tell her parents what had happened. Her mother and father both fell into depression, she says. \"I felt so ashamed of everything that was going on and that I'd put them in this situation,\" she says. Ayesha contacted Reddit several times. On one occasion, a video was deleted almost immediately but it took four months to remove another. And it didn't end there. The deleted content had already been shared on other social media sites and eventually appeared back on the original subreddit a month later. The subreddit that shamed and harassed Ayesha was set up and moderated by a user called Zippomad - a name that would eventually provide the clue to tracking him down. As moderator, Zippomad was supposed to make sure his subreddit discussion group followed Reddit's rules. But he did the opposite. . Since first tracking his subreddit, I've seen him create new versions of it three times - after each previous version was shut down by Reddit due to complaints. Each new incarnation used a variation of the same name, which includes a racial slur too offensive to repeat. Each one was filled with the same material - and each had thousands of active users. The trade in nudes has become widespread enough for experts in online abuse to give it a name: collector culture. Clare McGlynn, a law professor at the University of Durham who's an expert on this kind of online abuse, says: \"This is not a phenomenon of perverts or weirdos or other oddballs who are doing this. There are too many of them, and it's tens of thousands of men.\". Trading images takes place in small, private chat groups in messaging apps as well as websites where tens of thousands of men gather, Prof McGlynn says. She says many of the men involved gain status in these communities by building up large collections of non-consensual images. This obsessive hoarding can make it hard to stamp out, as Ayesha found out when deleted videos were simply reposted from other collections. The Secret World of Trading Nudes. Monika Plaha investigates the disturbing online trade in sexually explicit images and video of women, often taken and posted on social media without their consent. Watch on BBC iPlayer.  (UK Only). Seven women who've tried to get their images removed from Reddit told me they didn't feel the company was doing enough to help. Four said the material was never removed by Reddit and some had to wait eight months before content was deleted. Reddit has told us it removed just over 88,000 non-consensual sexual images last year and says it takes the issue \"extremely seriously\". It says it uses automated tools and has a team of staff to find and remove intimate images published without permission. It adds that it regularly takes action, including closing down forums. \"We know we have more work to do to prevent, detect, and action this content even more quickly and accurately, and we are investing now in our teams, tools, and processes to achieve this goal,\" a company spokesperson said. Like tech companies, UK law is struggling to protect women from having their private images shared online. . When Georgie was contacted by a stranger and told explicit images of her were being shared on the internet, she went to the police. She knew that only one person should have had access to them. \"I can't even compute how many people might have already seen them? And there is no way of stopping more people seeing them. In this moment, right now, people might be looking at them,\" she says. Her ex-partner texted her to admit sharing the images, but she says he told her \"he didn't mean to hurt or embarrass me\". That part of his confession turned out to be a legal loophole. Existing legislation against revenge porn across the UK requires proof that the person sharing photos without permission is doing it to cause distress to the victim. The Law Commission, an independent advisory body to the government, has recommended removing the requirement to prove intent to cause harm. But the Online Safety Bill currently progressing through Parliament does not include that change. I wanted to track down Zippomad, the Reddit user who created the forum targeting South Asian women - including Ayesha. As I looked through his history of comments on the site, there was no real name, email address or pictures to be found. Only his username provided a clue as to who he was - he collected Zippo lighters and had one for sale. So I got in touch using a fake account and offered to buy it. He agreed to set up a meeting and our undercover reporter finally came face-to-face with the man who had created the forum where the privacy of so many women had been violated. His name is Himesh Shingadia. He's university-educated and works as a manager at a large company. It wasn't who I expected to find at all. After Panorama contacted him, Mr Shingadia deleted his subreddit. In a statement, he says the group had been intended to \"appreciate South Asian women\". Due to the high number of users, he says he found it impossible to moderate the forum. He says he never shared anyone's private details or traded images himself and says he helped to remove some sexually explicit material when asked to by women. \"Zippomad is deeply embarrassed and ashamed of his actions, this does not reflect his real personality,\" the statement says. Reddit has also removed the other, similar groups that we highlighted to the company. It means almost a thousand women have, at last, had their images taken down - but that's little comfort after the pain of unwanted exposure. . Tech companies and legislators will need to make changes to prevent more women from being exploited by this trade. As Georgie says about the ex-partner who shared her images: \"I don't want to punish him. I want him to never do it again.\".

{"a": "Shamima Begum, who fled the UK and joined the Islamic State group, was smuggled into Syria by an intelligence agent for Canada. Files seen by the BBC show he claimed to have shared Ms Begum's passport details with Canada, and smuggled other Britons to fight for IS. Ms Begum's lawyers are challenging the removal of her citizenship, arguing she was a trafficking victim. Canada and the UK declined to comment on security issues. Ms Begum was 15 when she and two other east London schoolgirls - Kadiza Sultana, 16, and 15-year-old Amira Abase - travelled to Syria to join the IS group in 2015. At the main Istanbul bus station, the girls met Mohammed Al Rasheed, who would facilitate their journey to IS-controlled Syria. A senior intelligence officer, at an agency which is part of the global coalition against IS, has confirmed to the BBC that Rasheed was providing information to Canadian intelligence while smuggling people to IS. The BBC has obtained a dossier on Rasheed that contains information gathered by law enforcement and intelligence, as well as material recovered from his hard drives, which provide extraordinary detail about how he operated. He told authorities that he had gathered information on the people he helped into Syria because he was passing it to the Canadian embassy in Jordan. Rasheed, who was arrested in Turkey within days of smuggling Ms Begum to IS, told authorities he had shared a photo of the passport the British schoolgirl was using. . The Metropolitan Police were searching for her, although by the time Canada received her passport details, Ms Begum was already in Syria. The dossier shows that Ms Begum was moved to Syria through a substantial IS people-smuggling network that was controlled from the group's de-facto capital in Raqqa. Rasheed was in charge of the Turkish side of this network and facilitated the travel of British men, women and children to IS for at least eight months before he helped Ms Begum and her two friends. . Ms Begum told . the BBC's forthcoming I'm Not A Monster podcast. : \"He organised the entire trip from Turkey to Syria\u2026 I don't think anyone would have been able to make it to Syria without the help of smugglers. \"He had helped a lot of people come in\u2026 We were just doing everything he was telling us to do because he knew everything, we didn't know anything.\". Rasheed kept information about the people he helped, often photographing their ID documents or secretly filming them on his phone. . One recording shows Ms Begum and her friends get out of a taxi and into a waiting car not far from the Syrian border. Rasheed also gathered information about IS, mapping the locations of the homes of Western IS fighters in Syria, identifying IP addresses and locations of internet cafes in IS-controlled territory, and taking screenshots of conversations he was having with IS fighters.  . In one conversation, Rasheed spoke to a man believed to be notorious British IS fighter and recruiter, Raphael Hostey, who says to him: \"I need you to work under me. Officially\u2026 I want you to help us bring people in.\". In a follow-up text, Rasheed asks Hostey: \"Can you explain a little, please?\" . Hostey says: \"Same thing that you're doing now, but you work for us bringing equipment, bringing in brothers and sisters\". Mohammed Al Rasheed replies: \"I am ready, brother.\" . Rasheed was arrested in the Turkish city of Sanliurfa not long after he had facilitated the girl's journey to Syria. In a statement to law enforcement, he said that the reason he had gathered information on everyone he had helped, including Shamima, was because \"I was passing this information to the Canadian embassy in Jordan\". Rasheed said that in 2013 he had gone to the Canadian Embassy in Jordan to try to apply for asylum. He said: \"They told me they were going to grant me my Canadian citizenship if I collect information about the activities of ISIS.\" . The BBC has been able to confirm that Rasheed passed in and out of Jordan multiple times between 2013 and his arrest in 2015. Tasnime Akunjee, the lawyer for the Begum family, said there will be a legal hearing in November to challenge the removal of Ms Begum's citizenship and \"one of the main arguments\" will be that then-Home Secretary Sajid Javid did not consider that she was a victim of trafficking. \"The UK has international obligations as to how we view a trafficked person and what culpability we prescribe to them for their actions,\" he said. Mr Akunjee said it was \"shocking\" that a Canadian intelligence asset was a key part of the smuggling operation - \"someone who is supposed to be an ally, protecting our people, rather than trafficking British children into a war zone\". \"Intelligence-gathering looks to have been prioritised over the lives of children,\" he said. Shamima Begum is now held in a detention camp in north-east Syria. Her citizenship was taken away in 2019 after she emerged from the ashes of the so-called IS caliphate. . A British government spokesperson said: \"It is our long-standing policy that we do not comment on operational intelligence or security matters.\". Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said he could not \"comment on intelligence matters\", but added that \"at the moment\" he did not recognise \"what's being reported\". . Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said intelligence services needed to be \"flexible\" and \"creative in their approaches\" to fight terrorism, but \"they are bound by strict rules\". . \"We will continue to ensure that proper oversight is done, and as necessary look at further steps\", he added, while speaking at a press conference in Ottawa. A Canadian Security Intelligence Service spokesman said he could not \"publicly comment on or confirm or deny the specifics of CSIS investigations, operational interests, methodologies or activities\".

{"a": "The New Shepard rocket and capsule system developed by US billionaire Jeff Bezos has had to abort a mission mid-flight over the Texas desert. . The rocket experienced what appeared to be a propulsion failure about one minute after leaving the launch pad. A motor pushed the capsule clear, enabling it to make a soft return to the ground with the aid of parachutes. New Shepard regularly carries people, but on this occasion the only payload was a batch of zero-G experiments. The incident occurred at an altitude of just over 28,000ft (8.5km) while the vehicles were moving upwards at 700mph (1,120km/h). The system is designed to sense problems in the booster rocket and then push the capsule away to a safe distance. Dr Erika Wagner, a senior director at Mr Bezos's Blue Origin space company, was doing the in-flight webcast commentary. \"It appears that we've experienced an anomaly with today's flight,\" she said shortly after the separation of the capsule from the rocket booster. \"This wasn't planned and we don't have any details yet.\". This was the 23rd mission of New Shepard since its introduction in 2015. In July 2021, on the system's 16th outing, it started carrying people on short hops above the atmosphere. The crew on that occasion included Jeff Bezos himself and his brother, Mark. Flight 18 gained international attention when it carried the Star Trek movie actor William Shatner aloft. Monday's mission was uncrewed. The capsule was carrying 36 payloads from academia, research institutions, and students from across the globe -  largely paid for by the US space agency Nasa. These experiments were aiming to exploit the particular conditions of weightlessness experienced at the top of the capsule's routine apogee of a little over 62 miles (100km). Had people been on board during the abort, they would have experienced a sharp jolt at the moment of separation but should have been none the worse for their experience on landing. The Federal Aviation Administration, which licenses commercial spaceflight in the US, said it would be investigating Monday's incident. . \"Before the New Shepard vehicle can return to flight, the FAA will determine whether any system, process or procedure related to the mishap affected public safety.

{"a": "Satellites can now measure the thickness of sea-ice covering the Arctic Ocean all year round. Traditionally, spacecraft have struggled to determine the full state of the floes in summer months because the presence of surface meltwater has befuddled their instruments. But by using new \"deep learning\" techniques, scientists have pushed past this limitation to get reliable observations across all seasons. The breakthrough has wide implications. Apart from the obvious advantage to ships, which need to know those parts of the Arctic that will be safe to navigate, there are significant benefits to climate and weather forecasting. . At the moment, there is considerable variation in the projections for when the polar ocean might be totally free of ice in an ever warmer world. Having an improved insight into the melting processes in those key months when floes are being reduced, in area and thickness, ought now to sharpen the output from computer models. \"Despite excellent efforts by many researchers, these climate models' predictions of when we'll see the first fully ice-free Arctic Ocean in summer - they vary by 30-plus years,\" Dr Jack Landy, from UiT The Arctic University of Norway, told BBC News. . \"We need to tighten those predictions so we're a lot more confident about what's going to happen and when - and how the climate feedbacks will accelerate as a consequence.\". The extent of Arctic sea-ice cover has been in decline for the entire period that satellites have been monitoring it, which is more than 40 years - a reduction running at . an average rate of 13% per decade. . But it's only really since 2011 that spacecraft have been able to consistently measure its thickness - and thickness (or more properly, volume) is the true measure of the floes' health. . That's because the extent of sea-ice cover is heavily dependent on whether the winds have spread out the floes or pushed them together. To measure thickness, scientists use satellite altimeters. The European Space Agency's (Esa) pioneering Cryosat-2 mission carries a radar to measure the difference in height between the top of the marine ice and the top of the water in the cracks, or leads, that separate the floes. From this difference, scientists can then, with a relatively simple calculation, work out the thickness of the ice. The approach works well in winter months, but in summer, when the snows on top of the ice, and the ice itself, start to melt, pooling water effectively dazzles the radar. Scientists can't be sure if the echo signal that returns to Cryosat is coming from the open ocean or from the surface of a meltpond sitting on the ice. May through to September - the key melt season - has been a blind period for the spacecraft. To solve the problem, researchers used an artificial intelligence (AI) technique in which an algorithm was able to learn and identify reliable observations from a vast library of synthetic radar signals. Prof Julienne Stroeve, from University College London (UCL), explained: \"We simulated what would be the echo shapes that we would get for different ice surface types - whether they had meltponds; whether it was flooded ice; or ice of different roughnesses; or simply leads. We created this huge database of physically based estimates of what the radar return should look like, and then we matched those to the individual radar pulses from the instrument to find echoes that matched the best.\". Esa has kept in its data archives all the Cryosat May-to-September measurements, even though for the past decade they've been of next to no use. But now, thanks to this new approach, Dr Landy's team has been able to go back through the records to recover full-year ice thickness measurements for the entire time the satellite has been operational. Dr Rachel Tilling worked extensively with Cryosat data before transferring her studies to the US space agency's recently launched Icesat-2 laser altimeter mission. She applauded the innovation. . \"Summer is when sea-ice extent in the Arctic is seeing its most rapid decline, and having this extra dimension will help us understand more about how the ice pack is changing,\" the Nasa scientist told BBC News. \"Icesat-2 has its own unique difficulties in summer but we're lucky that its photon-counting technology means we can still measure the height of sea-ice, water and melt ponds year-round. \"Having said that, Cryosat-2 will always be my first love so I'm really excited to see it being used in this novel way.\". A chief beneficiary of the new thickness measurements would be Inuit populations in the Arctic, said Dr Michel Tsamados, also from UCL. \"[They] have identified sea-ice roughness and slush (melted snow and ice) as a key impediment for safe travel on the ice with the changing climate already negatively affecting these characteristics and causing increased travel accidents and search-and-rescues,\" he explained. . \"Both are related to the thickness of the ice. Therefore, measuring throughout the full year the sea-ice thickness from space from Cryosat-2 but also Icesat-2 and other satellite sensors will eventually help provide better maps to the Inuit populations for safe travel over this rapidly changing terrain.\" . Dr Landy and colleague have published their new Cryosat approach . in the journal Nature. . ."},

{"a": "A rare photograph of a comet that will never be seen from Earth again has won a prestigious photography prize. The image shows a piece of Comet Leonard's tail breaking off and being carried away by the solar wind. The comet made a brief appearance to Earth after being discovered in 2021, but has now left our Solar System. The Royal Observatory Greenwich in London runs the Astronomy Photography of the Year competition and called the image \"astonishing\". It also awarded two 14-year-old boys in Sichuan, China, the prize for Young Astronomy Photographer of the Year. The images are on show in an exhibition at the National Maritime Museum in London from Saturday. \"Comets look different from hour to hour - they are very surprising things,\" explained the winning photographer Gerald Rhemann, from Vienna, Austria. The picture was taken on Christmas Day 2021 from an observatory in Namibia, home to some of the world's darkest skies. He had no idea that the comet's tail would disconnect, leaving the sparkling dust trail in its wake. . \"I was absolutely happy to take the picture - it's the highlight of my photography career,\" he told BBC News. Astronomer Dr Ed Bloomer, who was one of the competition judges, said the image was one of the best comet photographs in history. \"The perfect astrophotograph is the collision of science and arts. Not only is it technically sophisticated and projects the viewer into deep dark space, but also it's visually arresting and emotional,\" Dr Hannah Lyons, assistant curator of art at Royal Museums Greenwich, told BBC News. The judges looked at more than 3,000 entries from around the world. For their winning image, Yang Hanwen and Zhou Zezhen, both 14, worked together to photograph the Andromeda Galaxy, one of the closest and largest neighbours of the Milky Way. The image shows the stunning colours of a galaxy near our own. \"I think this photo shows how gorgeous our nearest neighbour is,\" Yang Hanwen said. The category Young Astronomy Photographer of the Year is for people aged under 16. Dr Lyons said she was \"blown away\" by the quality of the young photographers, \"producing the most remarkable images\". This image by Slovakian photographer Filip Hrebenda shows the Northern Lights reflected on a freezing Icelandic lake above the Eystrahorn mountain. . Peter Szabo was highly commended for Young Astronomy Photographer of the Year for this photograph of the Moon, which he took in Debrecen, Hungary. The image uses high-quality processing to show the Moon's surface in incredible detail, revealing a sight that is familiar to most people but in an extraordinary way. P\u00e9ter Felt\u00f3ti captured this image from Hungary. The IC 1805 is an area of huge amounts of ionised gas and interstellar dust. A strong stellar wind blows the surrounding material outwards, creating a cave-like hollow shape in a gas cloud. . \"It is very difficult to capture dark nebula with any kind of clarity,\" explained Dr Ed Bloomer. Astrophotography was important, he added, because it revealed features of the cosmos that the human eye couldn't see just by looking at the night sky. Weitang Liang took this picture of the Helix Nebula in R\u00edo Hurtado, Chile, at the Chilescope observatory. \"It's easy to see how the ancients used to stargaze into the heavens and imagine that the cosmos was looking back, keeping a watchful eye over us,\" judge Imad Ahmed said. This image by Pauline Woolley, combining pictures taken by large telescopes, won the prize for innovation. It shows how the sun changes over time using the idea of tree-ring dating. Using an ordinary camera, Lun Deng captured this image of Milky Way rising above the Minya Konka Mountain, the highest peak in Sichuan China. All images subject to copyright."},

{"a": "The US says it will ease internet curbs on Iran to counter Tehran's clampdown on protests which were sparked by a woman's death in police custody. \"We are going to help make sure the Iranian people are not kept isolated and in the dark,\" said US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken. The relaxation of software controls will allow American tech firms to expand their business in Iran. At least 35 people have been killed in the worst unrest in Iran for years. Mahsa Amini, 22, fell into a coma last week, hours after morality police arrested her for allegedly breaking headscarf rules. . Officers reportedly beat Ms Amini's head with a baton and banged her head against one of their vehicles. The police have said there is no evidence of any mistreatment and that she suffered \"sudden heart failure\". Anti-government protests continued for an eight straight night on Friday, while pro-regime rallies also took place in Tehran and other cities. . Mr Blinken said . the partial relaxation of internet restrictions.  was a \"concrete step to provide meaningful support to Iranians demanding that their basic rights be respected\". It was clear, he added, that the Iranian government was \"afraid of its own people\". The US treasury said the move would help counter the Iranian government's attempt to \"surveil and censor\" its people. But it is unlikely to have an immediate impact as it \"does not remove every tool of communications repression\". Billionaire Elon Musk . said on Twitter.  that he would activate his satellite internet firm, Starlink, to provide internet services to Iran in response to Mr Blinken's announcement. Starlink provides internet services via a huge network of satellites and is aimed at people who live in remote areas who cannot get high-speed internet. US officials said that the updated license did not cover hardware supplied by Mr Musk but his firm and others were welcome to apply for permission to the treasury. Footage shared on social media on Friday showed large crowds of protesters gather in several Tehran neighbourhoods after dark, while other incidents occurred elsewhere the country. In the protests women have defiantly taken off their hijabs and burned them, or cut off their hair in front of cheering crowds. . While spreading across much of the country, many of the early protests were concentrated in western Iran, particularly areas with large Kurdish populations, the group Ms Amini belonged to.  . On Friday, reports emerged from Oshnavieh, in Iran's West Azerbaijan Province, which borders Kurdistan, showing widespread protests, as well as suggestions demonstrators had taken control of large parts of the city. The BBC was unable to confirm this. . Videos posted from Oshnavieh showed large crowds of people marching through city streets with no police presence, while loud explosions could be heard. . Friday also saw pro-regime demonstrations in Tehran and other cities, with those present declaring support for Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has been a target of anti-government protesters. . President Ebrahim Raisi spoke at a pro-government event, saying he would not allow the country's security to be \"threatened\". . \"We will not allow people's security to be put at risk under any circumstances,\" he said, shortly after returning from the United Nations General Assembly in New York. . Stressing that Iran's \"enemies\" wanted to exploit the unrest, Mr Raisi said the government would listen to criticism over Ms Amini's death, but would not be influenced by \"rioting\". ."},

{"a": "Activists in Iran are expressing concern about widespread internet outages and residents being unable to access social media. Anger has circulated online after over a week of protests sparked by the . death of a Kurdish woman.  in police custody. Internet monitoring group NetBlocks said Instagram and WhatsApp - two of the major communication tools that Iran usually allows - had been restricted. WhatsApp said it was working to keep Iranian users connected. The two Meta-owned apps have millions of Iranian users and have become increasingly popular after authorities blocked other platforms in recent years, including Facebook and Twitter. Telegram, YouTube and TikTok have also periodically been closed down. The latest intermittent blackouts follow the . eruption of nationwide protests.  over Mahsa Amini's death. The 22-year-old had been detained for allegedly failing to adhere to hijab (headscarf) rules. . NetBlocks reported that the internet was partially reconnected on Thursday night but that on Friday it was suffering a \"nation-scale loss of connectivity\" again. . \"People in Iran are being cut off from online apps and services,\" Instagram chief Adam Mosseri tweeted, adding that \"we hope their right to be online will be reinstated quickly\". But others accused Meta of being complicit in disconnecting users. Meta has a team of Persian-speaking reviewers who look at and remove content that violates their rules. If a post that has broken Meta's . community standards.  has been reported by users or flagged by technology, it will be taken down. Some shared their evidence that content supporting the Iranian protests had been blocked by Meta. . People also reported not being able to access their WhatsApp accounts even when trying to use a VPN and proxy. Ordinarily, website access is heavily restricted by government filters and only those with VPNs can access uncensored content from overseas websites. But this ban seems different. . So what is really going on?. The internet blackouts largely come from Iran's biggest mobile phone operator being offline. Iran Mobile Communications Company has more than 60 million customers. Earlier in the week, the communications minister blamed security reasons for the disruption. But Isik Mater from NetBlocks . told the BBC. : \"The internet is one of the biggest tools that the Iranian authorities have got in their hands when unrest breaks out on the streets.\". She says because there is no private broadcast network in Iran, the internet is the \"only place\" where protesters can share their voice. Miss Amini's death has unleashed anger over issues including personal freedoms and economic challenges in Iran. . Protesters - many of whom are women who have been waving and burning their veils - say they fear an escalating crackdown. . \"We are worried that the world will forget about Iran as soon as the regime shuts down the internet - which is already happening,\" one activist, who wanted to remain anonymous, said. . Most of the protests and campaigns are organised by people over social media and if they cannot get connected then it becomes much more difficult to mobilise. . Shayan Sardarizadeh from the BBC's disinformation unit said: \"Shutting down internet connections nationwide is the nuclear option for Iranian authorities, only triggered when they fear protests are on a scale that pose an existential threat to the regime. \"It is an effective tool that severely harms the ability of protesters to organise, communicate and inform the outside world, but it also carries a huge cost for the Iranian economy, businesses and public services. \"However, Iranian authorities have shown time and again that when faced with a choice between a severe hit to the economy and cracking down on political unrest at any cost, they will always choose the latter.\". Clamping down heavily on protesters and internet blackouts has worked to suppress people in Iran in the past. . But fears are growing that the situation could escalate to something . like 2019 protests that erupted.  over petrol price rises, the bloodiest in the Islamic republic's history. . During those protests, the internet was cut off for days at a time. . Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi has said protesting is allowed in the country but \"rioting\" will not be tolerated. \"Protests have always happened in Iran. The protesters are heard. However, protests must be distinguished from rioting,\" he said. Follow Shiona McCallum . on Twitter @shionamc."},

{"a": "Nasa's giant Moon rocket has completed a fuelling test that should open the way to it making a maiden flight. Controllers managed to fill the Space Launch System vehicle with 2.7 million litres of liquid hydrogen and oxygen on Wednesday - a task that had previously proved impossible due to leaks. Those leaks appear now to have been fixed, or rather engineers know how to manage them during the tanking process. The rocket could launch as soon as next Tuesday. However, the US space agency says a number of factors will have to be considered before a \"go\" decision is made. . \"I don't like to get ahead of the data,\" said flight director Charlie Blackwell-Thompson. \"I'd like the team to have the opportunity to go look at it, to see if there are changes we need to make to our loading procedure, our timelines, or if we're good as is.\". The 100m-tall vehicle is standing on launch pad 39B at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. . If it does get a \"go for launch\" next week, it will endeavour to send a capsule, called Orion, on a 37-day journey around the Moon, ending in a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean. . It would be a demonstration ahead of astronauts climbing aboard SLS-Orion for a repeat mission in 2024. The sequence is part of Nasa's Artemis programme, which seeks to return humans to the lunar surface after an absence of more than 50 years. . The US space agency tried to launch the SLS rocket on 29 August and again on 3 September. But on both occasions it was bedevilled by hydrogen escaping from feed lines - among other issues. . Damaged seals had to be replaced and then tested, which was the purpose of Wednesday's exercise. And although controllers once again saw leak behaviour, they were able to implement measures to keep the losses within acceptable bounds. . What is more, controllers were able to fully tank both the core stage and upper-stage of the rocket, and get them into their flight-ready configuration. This included prepping the four big engines at the base of the rocket which have to be taken down to an extremely low operating temperature. Whether Nasa can now proceed with a launch could depend on an unrelated matter to do with batteries in the rocket's flight termination system (FTS). The FTS is a series of explosives that would destroy the vehicle in the event it veered off course during the ascent. The batteries were certified for a period of time that has now elapsed. Nasa believes the batteries are still in good order and is working to have the certification extended. . The waiver would come from the US Space Force, which oversees flight safety in the vicinity of Kennedy and the other launch pads at Cape Canaveral. If the extension is not granted, the rocket will have to be rolled back into the workshop to have the FTS reset, delaying a launch by several weeks. And, of course, even if all the technical hurdles can be negotiated, Nasa will need to keep an ever watchful eye on the weather. There are storm systems moving around the Gulf of Mexico and in the Atlantic that could prove problematic, depending how they evolve over the next week."},

{"a": "Sir Salman Rushdie remains in hospital in the US, a fortnight after suffering \"life-changing\" injuries in a stabbing in New York state. . The Satanic Verses author has faced death threats for more than 30 years, ever since Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa - a formal proclamation by an Islamic legal scholar - calling for him to be killed. . Before the February 1989 decree, publicly at least, Iran had largely ignored the controversial book - but then, just hours before the fatwa was issued, a meeting took place at Tehran's main airport between two British imams and an Iranian government minister. . Bad weather closed in on the Iranian capital as Kalim Siddiqui and Ghayasuddin Siddiqui arrived at Mehrabad Airport. Both men had been attending a conference in Tehran to mark a decade since the country's Islamic Revolution. They were now trying to get home to the UK. . Inside the airport, they bumped into an Iranian government minister - Mohammad Khatami - who asked to have a private word with Kalim. . \"They went to a corner and chatted,\" Ghayasuddin would later explain in the BBC's 2009 documentary, The Satanic Verses Affair. When Kalim returned, he explained what they had spoken about. \"He was asking my view about Salman Rushdie - and I told him, 'You know, something drastic has to happen,'\" recounted Ghayasuddin. . Kalim told his travelling companion that the minister had been on his way to see Iran's then-Supreme Leader and top Shia Muslim religious authority, Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. A few hours later, the ayatollah issued the fatwa. . Not only was it made against the Satanic Verses' author, but also its publishers, editors and translators. \"I call on all valiant Muslims wherever they may be in the world to kill them without delay, so that no one will dare insult the sacred beliefs of Muslims henceforth,\" it read. . Sir Salman - who was knighted in 2007 - had published his controversial fourth novel in late 1988. The book's title refers to a disputed historical account in Islamic theology. The Prophet Muhammad is said to have been dictating two verses of the Koran, later abandoned because they were the result of deception by the devil. . Many Muslims argued Sir Salman's novel referenced Islamic theology and was a grave insult to their faith. They also objected, among other things, to characters depicting prostitutes being given the same names as wives of the Prophet. For more than six months up until the fatwa, there had been protests across the world. The book had been banned in several countries including India - and demonstrations in Pakistan had left several people dead. In the UK, copies were burned in Bolton and Bradford. . But, until then, there had not been a huge public outcry from Iran's leaders. Had this airport meeting, later claimed by both Siddiquis to have been a chance encounter, secured the fatwa?. Kalim and Ghayasuddin were not related, they just happened to have the same last name. Like Sir Salman, both were born in British-ruled India - before the 1947 Partition - and had settled in the UK. For several years in the late 1980s, the imams had been trying to forge closer ties with Ayatollah Khomeini's Islamic government. . Despite being a Sunni Muslim, Kalim admired what had happened in 1979 in Iran - a predominantly Shia Muslim country. He viewed the revolution as having freed Islam from Western domination by overthrowing the Western-backed Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. . Kalim later said he believed he may have been \"partially responsible\" for the fatwa. \"I met a minister, a cabinet minister at the airport. In the VIP lounge, he asked me about the Satanic Verses and about Rushdie. And I told him what I knew about it, and he went back to the imam [Ayatollah Khomeini], I suppose, I presume, and the fatwa followed later that morning.\". \"You feel proud of it?\" asked journalist Ludovic Kennedy in 1992, during an interview for BBC Radio 4's Beyond Belief series. \"Absolutely. Yes.\". Journalist Yasmin Alibhai-Brown says Kalim also made the same claim to her around that time. She added: \"Some of the ayatollahs hadn't even read the book\". Ed Husain, a writer on religion and extremism who used to be a close friend of Ghayasuddin, has also spoken of the significance of the airport meeting. . In 2019, he told the . BBC's podcast series Fatwa.  that Ayatollah Khomeini had not been minded to do anything about Sir Salman Rushdie because he was just a \"foreign author in another country\". . It had been the British imam, said Mr Husain, who had pushed Iran's autocratic political and religious leader - urging that he \"must do something for the Muslims\". . He said it meant a British Muslim had approached \"a fascist government asking for a theocratic leader to issue a fatwa on one of their citizens back in a free country\". . When asked if he was saying the fatwa had been requested from the UK, Mr Husain replied, \"yes\".  . However, there are accounts which play down Kalim's influence. . \"Popular mythology\" maintains Kalim as the \"grand master of the fatwa, but this simply is not the case,\" states a biography of his travelling companion Ghayasuddin. . The book - A Very British Muslim Activist, as told by C Scott Jordan - says regular, abrupt and unscheduled meetings with ministers to discuss the week's hot topic \"were part and parcel\" of the Siddiquis' trips to Iran. . \"This week, as the buzz would have it, it appeared that Salman Rushdie's book had wound up on the desk of Ayatollah Khomeini and, being the leader of the Islamic state, it was incumbent upon him to act.\" . The authorised biography says the minister, Mohammad Khatami - who would later become president - did ask Kalim's opinion, but says it is not known whether it was passed on to the ayatollah - or would have made any difference. \"To think a religious proclamation that had been carefully debated and reasoned by religious scholars had any influence from a foreign cheerleader in the few hours before its official release is nothing short of ridiculous,\" it says. . Kalim died in 1996. Speaking after the recent attack on Sir Salman, Kalim's son, Iqbal, says it was pure coincidence that his father happened to be in Iran around the time the fatwa was issued. The moment the Iranian minister approached him asking for background information \"was the first time Dad knew about\" a fatwa, he says. \"He never felt any involvement or responsibility for the fact the fatwa came out.\". But Iqbal also says his father never expressed any regret about supporting the proclamation. British Muslims opposed to The Satanic Verses fell roughly into two camps when it first came out. . Firstly, there were those who fought the publication by calling for the UK legal system to change - extending the blasphemy law beyond Christianity to other faiths. They never got their way - instead the law was abolished in England and Wales in 2008, and in Scotland in 2021. . Then, there were those in the Siddiquis' camp - calling for something more fundamental from within Islam itself. Some men, who felt their views on the novel had not been listened to or respected by British society, began to present themselves as the legitimate representatives and gatekeepers of British Muslims. . Kalim was one of them. Late in 1989, he and his supporters noisily took over a meeting of several hundred Muslims in Manchester. The interruption came a day after the BBC had reported the result of a poll which had suggested only 35% of British Muslims supported the fatwa. . Kalim asked the audience if they agreed with the decree. \"Practically all those present raised their hands,\" wrote Kalim later. \" I had demonstrated, in the most dramatic fashion possible, the total unity and consensus that existed on this issue among Muslims in Britain.\". For Kalim, Islamic institutions would better represent British Muslims. He went on to launch a Muslim Parliament in 1992, which became a forum for debate and discussion. But it declined after his death and ceased in 1997. According to its former deputy leader, Jahangir Mohammed, Kalim set up the organisation on the back of the popularity he gained as a result of the fatwa. . But Yasmin Alibhai-Brown says Kalim made an \"instinctive power grab\" and did not represent ordinary Muslims. The Muslim Parliament was \"a laughable thing\", she says. \"In what sense was it a parliament? It was a parliament without anybody voting.\". Ghayasuddin is still alive, but not well enough to speak to the media. His son Asim - like Kalim's son, Iqbal - also says the Tehran airport encounter was a chance meeting and there is no evidence Kalim's views were passed on to Ayatollah Khomeini. . Asim says his father distanced himself from the fatwa decades ago - a sentiment echoed by Yasmin Alibhai-Brown. \"[Ghayasuddin] changed his mind and became a real fighter for free speech, it was a really courageous thing to do,\" she says. . Whether or not Kalim was the reason for Ayatollah Khomeini's edict that day in 1989, we are unlikely to ever know for sure. There were other factors swirling around the upper echelons of the Iranian leadership at that time. . Many Iranian citizens were disillusioned as the promises of the revolution 10 years before had not been fulfilled, while the supreme leader himself was terminally ill and still bitter after reluctantly agreeing to end a brutal eight-year war with Saddam Hussain's Iraq. Some journalists speculated whether the fatwa may have provided a convenient distraction from the embarrassment of agreeing to a ceasefire with Baghdad. After his death in June 1989, Ayatollah Khomeini's son told journalists his father had never read The Satanic Verses. His passing also meant the fatwa would be in place for eternity - as such a decree can only be reversed by the Islamic scholar who issued it. . In the late 1990s, Iran's government - led by President Khatami - backed away from the fatwa, declaring it would neither \"support nor hinder\" Salman Rushdie's assassination. But in 2017, the current Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei - when asked if the fatwa was still binding - said: \"The decree is as Imam Khomeini issued.\" . Dozens of people died in protests over the novel, while others - including the book's Japanese translator - were killed after the fatwa. Sir Salman was forced to remain in hiding for almost a decade. . Now, more than three decades later, he has suffered life-changing injuries in an attack at a public event in New York state in the US. . Iran has \"categorically\" denied any link with the alleged perpetrator, instead blaming the writer himself. The young man accused of the stabbing - Hadi Matar, 24 - has not said whether his alleged actions were influenced by the fatwa. . He has reportedly said he has only read two pages of the Satanic Verses."},

{"a": "Leading firms have begun a scheme to help black and minority ethnic students get jobs as chemistry researchers. . The initiative follows an investigation which found that racism was \"pervasive\" in chemistry research. . There is just one black chemistry professor in the UK and black people in the field are less well paid and less likely to get promotions. . The initiative, called . Broadening Horizons. , is led by the Royal Society of Chemistry. . Its chief executive, Dr Helen Pain, said the aim was to make a \"step change\" in getting black people in particular to pursue a career in science. . The RSC's investigation, published in March, found that racism was ''pervasive'' in the chemical sciences.  and talented students and early stage researchers were leaving the profession at every stage of their career. The problem of racism is not exclusive to chemistry.  A BBC investigation last year revealed the extent of the problem across all the sciences. . The RSC is among.  several scientific bodies and universities trying to solve the problem. . . In an investigation, it found that in chemistry, minority ethnic researchers are less likely to get grant funding or promotions and are paid significantly less. . In 2019/20 the average grant for a minority ethnic chemical sciences researcher was \u00a3320,000, compared with \u00a3355,000 for white colleagues. . The RSC investigation went beyond the situation in chemical sciences. . It also highlighted that 37% of FTSE 100 companies have no representation of minority ethnicities on their board, despite a target set by an independent review, also in 2016, to have one director from a minority ethnic background on every board by 2021. The report \"shocked\" a number of chemistry-led industries into action, according to Dr Pain. \"It spurred them to bring the community of chemical scientists together and act in a way that can actually make a difference.\". Several firms are working with the RSC to provide black and minority ethnic students studying in the UK and the Republic of Ireland with mentoring, industrial experience and the opportunity to apply for internships over three years. . Among them are RSSL, Syngenta, Unilever, GSK, Oxford Nanopore Technologies, AM Technology, Astra Zeneca, Johnson Matthey and BASF. Grace Odunlade is among 94 students who are about to begin the scheme. She is a third year undergraduate studying medicinal chemistry at Trinity College, Dublin. Her parents came to Dublin from Nigeria when she was two. She believes the scheme will be a big help in getting a career in chemistry. \"I am a first-generation immigrant's child, so my parents didn't have the network that many people in my course have. . \"Over the summer, some people were talking about internships they had obtained and how they had got them through family friends. I can't say the same because of my background.\". Victor Ezeajughu came from Nigeria to study a masters degree in pharmaceutical science at Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen, and has been applying for jobs in the UK. . So far he has applied for 15 jobs. None have been successful. \"Various organisations say they are for diversity and equal opportunities, but that is only talk. None of them actually do,\" he told BBC news. But he feels that the Broadening Horizons scheme will make a difference to his job prospects. \"It brings me closer to the organisations that I'd really love to work with, such as GSK and AstraZeneca. \"I am going to see the board of directors and the main brains in these companies one-on-one, and I am going to be able to communicate with them and express myself.\".

{"a": "Government forces in Ukraine are trying to seize the initiative from Russian troops before the arrival of winter. A counter-offensive is already under way in the south and the Ukrainians are now preparing to expand that in the east to take back land lost in Donbas and around Kharkiv in the north. Quentin Sommerville and camera-journalist Darren Conway have been given exclusive access to a unit of Ukrainian troops. The air is thick with the smell of burning sunflowers, and the pat-pat-pat of Russian cluster bombs can be heard landing across the fields, setting fire to a crop which stands, heads bowed, awaiting a harvest that's unlikely to come.  . A self-propelled gun roars through the field, its caterpillar tracks tearing up the rich Donbas earth. The National Guard hold this ground in Ukraine's east - territory that Vladimir Putin has claimed as central to his war aims. It will be taken \"step-by-step\", he said. But for now, Russian progress has been reduced to a crawl.  . And hanging heavy in the air, among the smoke and dust, is something else - expectation. Here in Donbas, and further north on the outskirts of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second city, the country's forces are braced for a counter-offensive.  . I recently left army positions in the south, around Kherson. It is the only city that Russian forces have captured west of the strategically important Dnipro River. Those same troops are now engaged in battle, supporting forces who have broken through Russian lines in at least three places, as part of a long-planned counter-offensive in the south. Strict Ukrainian reporting restrictions are in place as the operation is under way.  . Here in Donbas, they remain tight-lipped. I'm not told the destination beforehand, and a unit press officer asks me not to name the regiment. He removes identifying patches from the men we film.  . Amid the din of artillery fire in a base under the cover of trees, Artyom, 35, says we are north of the city of Siversk, some 8km (five miles) from the Russian front line. \"How close do you get to them?\" I ask. \"Thirty metres,\" he replies, \"would you like to see?\". These are all defensive positions but the success around Kherson leads many to think that more offensives are planned here and further north. I'm handed over to a red-haired guardsman who goes by the name of Svarog. He is 26, with a beard - \"I'd look 18 without it,\" he says with a grin. But after six months of fighting in this war, and in Donbas before, he's battle-hardened. . His unit saw its hardest fighting in July in nearby Lyschansk and Sivierodonetsk, where they were heavily outnumbered. . The fighting here is different. \"They are not coming in such big numbers,\" Svarog says.\u202f\"They no longer advance in battalion groups - they advance in a platoon, a detachment.\" One unit commander had explained that in the field they have one man for every three of the enemy. In Sivierodontesk it was one to seven. . I'm taken on foot to the most forward position. The shelling is constant but at a distance. Instead there is a more immediate threat - anti-personnel mines. I count five as we walk along a muddy path to the river. . At the riverbank, we head into a network of trenches and I'm told to whisper. It is only an observation post but it is packed full of weaponry. \"Where are the Russians?\", I ask a guardsman. He points to the opposite bank of the river, 30 or so metres away.  . Nearby are craters, and a shell from a spent Russian rocket. This, first and foremost, is as an observation post, not a combat position, I'm told. \"But if there is a threat that they are crossing over to our riverbank, then we will open fire,\" the guardsman says. . In a nearby village that looks like so much of this part of Ukraine, broken apart by artillery, mostly abandoned by its residents, I meet Sergiy, 65, and his dog Mukha. . I ask the obvious question - why doesn't he leave? \"My parents lived and died in this house,\" he replies. \"I can't go anywhere. I sent my wife away and live here on my own. Everything is okay, I have food and a small farm. The dog is not hungry.\". Sergiy says he's proud to be Ukrainian. He's not a \"nationalist\" but says he believes in Ukraine and the Armed Forces. . But others here are more ambivalent. Svarog's unit say that a marked difference from when they fought around Kyiv is the divided loyalty of some of those they have met.  . I walk with his men down another ruined village lane. They are, of course, armed and we are all wearing body armour and helmets. A gaggle of geese is almost enough to drown out the artillery duel taking place above our heads. We are invited into a courtyard, full of grape vines and roses, where a family go about their business as if war wasn't raging around them.  . Julia, 35-year-old nursery school teacher, laughs when I ask her about living under this threat. \"Imagine that war came to you and you had to pack up and leave your home in 24 hours,\" she asks. \"You would, just like me, try to hang on to what you have spent your whole life making.\" . Her sister Liliia stands nearby. It is her 19th birthday on the day I visit. On her wrist she has a tattoo - \"dulcius ex asperis\" it reads - Latin for \"sweetness follows hardship\". . Their father berates the Ukrainian government for failing to negotiate. \"They need to sit down at the negotiating table and come to an agreement. It's not right to carry on like this,\" he says. . Julia disagrees. Quietly she says: \"We understand, and we believe that reason will prevail. We'll wait a month, or two for the front line to even out and things will be good again here.\". Days later, I travel south and meet Ruslan, a combat medic chief who, despite seeing the daily human catastrophe of this war, still fizzes and whirrs with good humour. When we arrange to meet him in a village not far from the front, I ask how I'll spot him.  . \"Look for the fluffy ambulance, you won't be able to miss it,\" he says.  . Sure enough, the vehicle arrived by the village bus stop covered in home-made camouflage netting, like a parade-float hedgehog. We follow him at speed to a frontline \"stabilisation point\", where the injured soldiers receive immediate life-saving care.  . The idiosyncrasies of combat medics are legendary. So it should be no surprise that when we arrive Yuri, the surgeon for Ruslan's medics, is wearing nothing but camouflage shorts. He has in his hand a metal detector. \"He's looking for gold,\" jokes Ruslan.  . After a while, Yuri's earphones whine and with a small army trowel, he produces a black lump of ore from the ground. \"It's just a hobby,\" he says, sheepishly.  . The clinic is piled high with supplies. \"We want to say thank you to our foreign donors,\" Ruslan says. \"We haven't unpacked yet. Sometimes we never have time to fully unpack.\" . He takes me through a handwritten notebook of all the injuries they have treated over the past month. Time of arrival, name, type of injury. \"The more writing on the page, the more difficult the case,\" says Ruslan. . Some 9,000 Ukrainian soldiers have died since the start of the war, says Ukrainian commander-in-chief Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi. Individual unit losses and injuries are a closely guarded secret. In Ruslan's thick notebook there were fewer deaths than I had imagined. \"We've come a long way since 2014,\" he says, referring to rapid modernisation of Ukrainian forces, including combat medics. . Ukrainian artillery is working all around us. A powerful M777 howitzer is firing nearby, and at night we hear a High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) firing its long-range munitions. These new weapons helped prepare the ground for the offensive in the south, and it is hoped they will do the same in the east.  . I sit with Vlad, a slight 26-year-old who is now the unit's ambulance driver. He was a ship's engineer (second class) until the start of the war. His frigate, the Hetman Sahaidachny, was scuttled to stop it falling into Russian hands. Before getting behind the wheel of the ambulance he was an artillery man, and can name every boom and blast, as well as the year and make of tank and armour passing the clinic.  . I ask him how he likes this duty compared to artillery. \"There's a lot of waiting around now,\" he says.  . But he doesn't have to wait for long. A truck arrives suddenly at the clinic, with screams coming from the rear. The clinic operates on radio silence, the first they know of casualties is usually when they arrive at the door.  . The first man is able to walk inside, but his right arm is hanging off, a gaping wound at his shoulder. The force of the explosion which detonated near him has broken his arm. A second man groans and shouts as he is lifted by Vlad and another medic on a stretcher into the clinic. He is covered in shrapnel wounds.  . For the next 15 minutes, the emergency room is a scene of calm-but-determined activity. Yuri attends to the more seriously injured man on the stretcher, assisted by nursing staff. Senior Lt Viktor attends to the man with badly injured arm. The patients are quickly bandaged, and covered in silver heat blankets then sent for further treatment.  . Yuri explains the next step. \"We have up to an hour to quickly provide medical assistance before the patient goes to the hospital where a traumatologist, surgeon and trauma brigade take care of the patient\". Both will recover but the more seriously injured soldier is unlikely to return to duty. Ruslan sits down and adds anther two names to his notebook. These entries are short.  . There would be four more injuries later that day, but in the meantime, Ruslan takes us to the trenches where casualties are first received.  . Mortars begin landing at a tree-line, beyond where we stand. \"It's good that they didn't hit the target, he laughs, now wearing full combat gear. That's Russian precision for you.\" . I ask him how they manage to retrieve casualties while under constant shelling. \"No-one will endanger personnel. So, no matter how hard it sounds, you can't lose strength and means, human resources, vehicles.  . \"When there's a lull, or when the battle stops or the enemy is out of ammunition, that's when the evacuation takes place immediately,\" he says. \"Until then, they try to save [casualties] on the spot with all the means they have. We've already lost too many combat medics.\" . As we leave the front, the skies darken and lightning appears on the horizon. Bad weather is on its way, summer is ending and fighting conditions will worsen. The deep snows of winter will arrive threatening to freeze battle lines in place. . But for now, there is something else in the air here, an expectation that after months of stalemate, Ukraine could be about to again strike back. Follow . Quentin Sommerville on Twitter."},

{"a": "The recently launched super space telescope James Webb has returned spectacular new imagery of Neptune. The observatory's infrared instruments highlight features not seen in such detail since the Voyager 2 probe flew past the planet in 1989. These include the rings and dust bands that encircle the ice giant. Scientists are also intrigued by the different cloud structures, which should tell them something novel about the workings of Neptune's atmosphere. . Beyond the planet itself are seven of the giant's 14 moons, the most significant of which is Triton. It appears star-like in the Webb imagery. That's because Neptune is darkened in the telescope's view by methane absorption at infrared wavelengths. Triton, on the other hand, reflects an average of 70% of the sunlight that strikes its icy surface. It's very bright. Prof Leigh Fletcher, from Leicester University, is at the Europlanet Science Congress in Granada, Spain, where everyone is \"trying to interpret this on our phones, but it's incredible to see those rings, and we're accessing wavelengths that no-one has seen before\".  . \"Its great to see how excited everyone is!\" he told BBC News. \"The longer wavelengths are brand new and could give us a window on to the deep circulation patterns, with a bright equatorial band that looks a bit like the bright bands of Jupiter and Saturn. . \"Neptune's powerful storms are as active as ever, and the whole Neptune family is represented here, with those ring moons and Triton.\". Neptune is the outermost planet in our Solar System, beyond Uranus and Saturn, but inside the dwarf planet Pluto. It circles the Sun at a distance of roughly 4.5 billion km, and takes 164.8 years to complete one revolution. . Like the other outer Solar System giants, its atmosphere contains a lot of hydrogen and helium. But there is a very strong presence of ices, of water, ammonia and methane. Neptune's diameter is close to 50,000km, or almost four times that of Earth. James Webb is a collaborative project of the US, European and Canadian space agencies."},

{"a": "Castles that have stood for hundreds of years are at risk of being damaged by climate change, conservation charity English Heritage warns. . The charity, which manages over 400 historic sites across England, highlighted six castles threatened by coastal erosion and rising sea levels. . They include Tintagel in Cornwall and Hurst Castle in Hampshire . It is appealing for money to repair walls and improve defences against storms and more powerful waves. . \"It seems to be that the whole natural dynamics of the coastline in some places have been accelerated by climate change,\" Rob Woodside, English Heritage's estates director, told BBC News. . \"What we're trying to do now is essentially buy time, so with places that we value, and people want to look after, we put measures in place to protect them.\". There is broad consensus among scientists that even if the greenhouse gas emissions that warm the Earth are dramatically cut, global sea levels will continue to rise for several hundred years. Higher sea levels mean more powerful waves coming closer to the shore, and faster coastal erosion. . These are the six sites that English Heritage says are most at risk: . Originally built by Tudor King Henry VIII between 1541 and 1544, a section of Hurst Castle's east wing collapsed into the sea in February 2021 after its foundations were eroded. As part of efforts to defend the castle 5,000 tonnes of granite boulders have been put in place to form a barrier, or \"revetment\". Henry VIII's Hurst Castle wall collapses in Lymington. Erosion is not a new problem at Tintagel. It has been under attack from wind and sea since being built in the 13th Century. There are regular cliff falls and English Heritage says funding is urgently needed to repair damage from the storms of last winter. Fourteenth Century Piel Castle is on a low-lying island around half a mile from the coast in Morecambe Bay.  Much of the island has already been lost to erosion and some of the castle fell into the sea in the 19th Century. English Heritage says the castle's keep and bastions are now at risk from both erosion and flooding. For 500 years, this Tudor fort in Devon has guarded the narrow entrance to the Dart Estuary as the last line of defence to protect Dartmouth from attack from the sea.  . The shape of the Garrison Walls creates pinch points or \"armpits\", where the tide focuses. English Heritage says these sections are extremely vulnerable to erosion and will be breached in the coming years if not protected. Calshot Castle sits on a vulnerable short spit of land in the River Solent. The site is at a low level making it vulnerable to rising sea levels and erosion. ."},

{"a": "HS2 Ltd has been granted an \"extensive\" injunction along the length of the high-speed line from London to Crewe to help tackle unlawful protests. The order makes going onto HS2 land without permission or disrupting work a potential contempt of court - the offence of ignoring a judge's ruling. It will not only apply to identified protestors but to \"persons unknown\". . HS2 welcomed the court judgement and said it was \"not intended to stop legitimate protest\". A High Court judge sitting at Birmingham's Civil Justice Centre, Mr Justice Julian Knowles, said the injunction struck \"a fair balance between the rights of the individual protestors and the general right and interests of HS2 and others who are being affected by the protests, including the national economy.\". Legal experts say this court order is one of the most far-reaching of its kind in English legal history. . Opponents have argued it will stifle peaceful opposition and even hamper ecologists who need access to monitor the build. . Protests against the line have cost an estimated \u00a3122 million. . Mr Justice Knowles took more than four months to consider almost 8,000 pages of evidence, including plans, statements and maps. The order covers a range of scenarios, including people \"interfering with\" access to the land or \"delaying or hindering\" any HS2 work. Mr Justice Knowles said he was \"satisfied that there has been significant violence, criminality and sometimes risk to the life of the activists, HS2 staff and contractors.\". He added that, while he had \"anxiously considered the geographical extent of the injunction along the whole of the HS2 route\", he had decided that \"such an extensive injunction is appropriate.\". He said he had studied the land plans and found that \"they are clear, detailed and precise. I reject any suggestion that they are unclear. They clearly show the land to which the injunction\u2026 will apply. \"I am satisfied that the trespass and nuisance will continue, unless restrained, and that the risk is both real and imminent.\". Breaking the injunction would be a contempt of court, which can lead to jail. An HS2 spokesperson said it would not be used to stop law-abiding protestors and said: \"As Mr Justice Knowles makes clear, this injunction will not, and is not intended to, stop legitimate protest. . \"Instead, we hope the injunction will prevent the violence, intimidation, and criminal damage these protests have frequently caused, harming the HS2 project and those working on it, and costing the UK taxpayer millions of pounds.\". Ricardo Gama from the law firm Leigh Day said it was \"definitely one of the biggest\" injunctions ever sought. . He said the only comparable case was the injunction used to evict the Insulate Britain protestors, which applied across the whole of the strategic road network. \"It criminalises a future action in a much more clear-cut and draconian way than the criminal law does,\" said Mr Gama. \"If there is a criminal offence, then there are safeguards in legislation and case law about what the offence constitutes and what the defence might be.\". Anti-HS2 activist Mark Keir said there had been \"no justice\" and called the awarding of the injunction \"a democracy-crippling decision\" that was \"deeply worrying\". Legal documents.  submitted to the court argued that: \"Given the extent of the HS2 Land, the term has a clear chilling effect on all forms of protest against HS2. \"Some HS2 land passes through high-density urban areas with multiple roads and public highways... It also covers woodland and other areas with public access and public rights of way.\". \"Most of HS2 land is not subject to any physical demarcation or barrier... Notwithstanding the 283 pages of maps which have been produced, the breadth scope and complexity of the land subject to the proposed injunction is such that it is in practical terms not possible for persons to reliably ascertain the scope of the injunction.\". The HS2 line passes through the Chiltern hills, where there are over 2,000 miles (3,219km) of footpaths. . According to the Chiltern Society, many have had to be diverted because of the construction, and there is a concern that walkers could mistakenly break the injunction and commit a criminal offence. Keith Hoffmeister, a society volunteer said: \"There is a danger that they set off on a nice walk across the countryside and start walking across a footpath that they might not even be aware is crossing HS2 land. . \"If they strayed off that footpath there is the potential for them to be committing a criminal offence - and likewise with the footpath maintenance volunteers who may be straying offline in order to cutback hedges. They could easily stray off the footpath and again be prosecuted by HS2 for trespassing.\". Matthew Stanton, head of planning and advocacy at Berks, Bucks & Oxon Wildlife Trust, said he was also worried volunteers and staff monitoring the impact of HS2's work on wildlife and their habitats might inadvertently find themselves wandering onto private land and falling foul of the injunction, if it were applied too strictly. He said: \"We are concerned about the impact the injunction will have on people's ability to monitor the work HS2 is doing in terms of ecological impact and that's because we have already had experiences where people feel intimidated going near HS2 land and we are concerned that security staff of HS2 will feel even more emboldened with such an injunction behind them. \"It's one thing trying to stop people having illegal camps on HS2 land but, if that is what HS2 wants, then just have an injunction that says that - don't have a catch-all injunction that basically means they can threaten to imprison anyone who even slightly affects their operations.\". HS2 was originally meant to connect London with Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. Work has already started on the first phase, linking London and the West Midlands. The next section will extend the line to Crewe. The final phase was to take HS2 to Manchester and Leeds. But the Leeds leg is being scrapped. . The government says HS2 will cut Birmingham to London journey times from one hour 21 minutes, down to 52 minutes. . The London and Birmingham leg was due to open at the end of 2026. But this is now expected between 2029 and 2033. The second phase was due to open in 2032-33, but has been pushed back to 2035-2040."},

{"a": "King Charles III is famous for his support of environmental and social causes over the years, but did you know he played a decisive role in the renaissance of traditional artisan cheese in the UK?. It is a perfect example of the way he has used his position to help support the issues he cares about. It may also hint at what a modern Carolean monarchy could look like. The story begins back in the early 1990s when a series of food scares had shaken confidence in British food. A raft of new hygiene rules designed for industrial cheesemakers was being applied to dairies producing farmhouse cheeses - including a potential ban on the use of unpasteurised milk. Across the country artisan cheesemakers were teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. . Randolph Hodgson was worried, as he had spent the previous decade attempting to revive British cheesemaking by promoting the best produce through his cheese shop in London's Covent Garden, Neal's Yard Dairy. \"I really believed it would be the end of the great tradition of cheesemaking in the UK once and for all,\" he says. Mr Hodgson had set up the Specialist Cheesemakers Association (SCA) to lobby for the interests of artisan producers and the association's work had caught the attention of the then Prince of Wales. Cheese is only as good as the milk that goes into it and the prince was keen to support the high welfare and environmental standards on the dairy farms producing artisan cheese. He was also interested in preserving traditional British farming and food productions skills. He had become a patron of the SCA in 1993 and got wind of the troubles the industry was facing. His response was typical of the his approach to problems, say former advisers. He decided to convene a meeting over lunch at Highgrove, his residence in Gloucestershire. The King likes \"connecting people and organisations in ways that open up possibilities and create solutions\", explains his former press secretary Julian Payne. King Charles doesn't tell people what to do, but brings them together to see if they can work out a solution among themselves, he added. Charles invited cheesemakers and cheesemongers to his country pile along with civil servants from the Ministry of Agriculture and government ministers. Mr Hodgson remembers the 1999 meeting well. \"Do we think it is important to keep these cheeses and traditions going?\" Charles asked. Everyone agreed it was. \"So, what are you going to do about it?\" was his next question for the room. The meeting ended with the civil servants agreeing to work with the cheesemakers to draw up a code of practice to ensure good hygiene in small dairies. It was, says Mr Hodgson, an \"incredibly important moment\" in the history of British cheese. \"He wasn't seeking attention for his support, he just brought everyone together and found a path through it all,\" he remembers. His intervention worked, says Tim Rowcliffe, a former chairman of the Specialist Cheesemakers Association. \"From that day on, we had a dialogue with authority rather than going to war,\" he says. And the industry has thrived. . Up in the hills of west Wales, I met Patrick Holden and his wife Becky who make a cheddar-style cheese called Hafod using unpasteurised milk from their 75 Ayrshire cows. Patrick says his farm was saved by the efforts of King Charles. \"He saw the need for farmers to add value to their milk,\" explains Patrick, who says his farm is only viable because he can treble the value of his milk by turning it into artisan cheese. Patrick is not alone. . There are now more than 700 different British and Irish farmhouse cheeses on the market: \"Probably more than the French, dare I say it,\" laughs Mr Rowcliffe. Artisan cheese has become a multimillion-pound-a-year industry supporting hundreds of small farms, thousands of jobs and which now exports British cheese all over the world. . The King has quietly helped drive forward all sorts of other causes by convening meetings, building bridges, and just getting people talking together. The rules have changed, of course. . Now he is King, Charles must remain politically neutral, but it is unclear if that will prevent him championing the causes he cares about. He is planning a low carbon coronation, for example. . Royal sources have confirmed to the BBC that deciding who will attend will be a \"balancing act\" between sticking to royal protocol and keeping the carbon footprint down. Buckingham Palace may tell Commonwealth leaders they do not need to attend, to reduce the number of aircraft flying to London, for instance. The King is also expected to use a state visit to France next month - the first of his reign - to highlight a scheme to plant millions of trees in Africa. . We understand he is unlikely to be promoting the virtues of British cheese during that trip, however."},

His Earthshot project is the biggest environmental prize ever with \u00a350m to be awarded over a decade. The aim is to find 50 solutions to the world's gravest environmental problems by 2030.

{"a": "A study of school uniforms in the US and Canada reveals high levels of so-called \"forever chemicals\". The chemicals, known as . PFAS. , are used to make clothing resistant to stains or water but they have been linked to asthma, obesity and fertility issues. Researchers found that uniforms made with 100% cotton showed higher levels than synthetic materials. . Exposing children to these chemicals may increase the long-term health risk, the scientists believe. . The issue is less of a concern in the UK because almost all retailers' own brand uniforms are PFAS free, say campaigners. . From fire-fighting foams to food packaging and textiles, PFAS chemicals are widely used because of their non-stick and water-resistant properties. . But researchers have long been concerned about these chemicals, known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances - because they don't break down under normal environmental conditions. . These \"forever chemicals\", which number in the thousands, persist in soil and water. However they can also accumulate in the human body when ingested. . While direct evidence linking them to health problems is mixed, scientists are concerned about exposure, particularly in young people whose lower body weight and sensitive development may result in a greater lifetime threat. . This latest study focuses on the contact with the chemicals that may occur as a result of wearing school uniforms. . It's estimated that around 20% of children in the US and Canada wear uniforms, in public and private schools. . \"All of these clothes that we targeted are polo shirts and khaki pants, the usual uniforms, but they were specifically marketed as a stain resistant,\" said Dr Marta Venier from Indiana University who led the study. . \"So we were selective in picking clothes that were labelled as stain resistant. And what we found was that PFAS were present in all of these items.\". The researchers looked for total fluorine levels in the products to indicate the presence of PFAS. They found that the school uniform samples had higher levels than weather-resistant outdoor wear. . Products made from 100% cotton contained more than synthetic products. The scientists believe that this is because synthetic items have a higher water and stain resistance. The researchers acknowledge that their study is small, involving 72 product samples labelled as water or stain resistant. The researchers also don't know how or if the PFAS in the clothing get into children's bodies. . \"We're chemists, not toxicologists. So we tend we try not to go into realms that are not necessarily ours,\" said Dr Venier. . \"But we know that PFAS have health concerns, so the idea that children wearing uniforms, that can continuously release these substances, is a concern,\" she said. . Growing worries about PFAS have seen some of the chemicals banned in the UK and EU. In the UK, environmental charity . Fidra.  has led a campaign to inform retailers about the presence of PFAS in school uniforms. . \"We found that people that bought uniforms, with these coatings, actually washed them more often, and replaced them just as much as people that didn't buy the stain-resistant ones,\" said Dr Clare Cavers, a senior project manager with Fidra. \"The stain resistant coatings came off uniforms after a 10 to 20 washes. So if they were buying the uniform for that function, it wasn't making any difference.\". As a result of their efforts, all major retailers in the UK now sell their own-brand school uniforms PFAS free, said Dr Cavers. . The move to eliminate PFAS from clothing and textiles is gathering pace with California ending the sale from 2025. The EU is also looking at a ban and the UK is also examining the idea as part of a post-Brexit chemical strategy. . The study has been published in . Environmental Science and Technology Letters. .

Telescopes will be watching from afar, including the new super space observatory James Webb. We've all seen how Hollywood would do it, with brave astronauts and nuclear weapons. But how do you protect Earth from a killer asteroid for real? . Nasa is about to find out. Its idea is simply to smash a spacecraft into one. . The thinking is you would only need to change the rock's velocity by a small amount to alter its path so that it misses Earth - provided you do it far enough in advance. . The Double Asteroid Redirection Test (Dart) mission will check out this theory with a near-head-on crash into 160m-wide Dimorphos at over 20,000km/h. . This should change its orbit around a much larger asteroid, called Didymos, by just a few minutes every day. . Nasa is promising some spectacular images from the 570kg-Dart probe as it goes in for the hit. \"Dart is the first planetary defence test mission to demonstrate running a spacecraft into an asteroid to move the position of that asteroid ever so slightly in space,\" explained Dr Nancy Chabot from the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, which leads the mission for Nasa. . \"This is the sort of thing, if you needed to, that you would do years in advance to just give the asteroid a small nudge to change its future position so that the Earth and the asteroid wouldn't be on a collision course,\" she told BBC News. Hitting Dimorphos will be quite the challenge. It's only in the last 50 minutes or so that Dart will be able to distinguish its target from 780m-wide Didymos. Navigation software must then adjust the spacecraft's trajectory to make a direct hit. \"Because of the speed of light and the distances involved, it's really not feasible for there to be a pilot sitting on the ground with a stick controlling the spacecraft. There just isn't enough time to respond,\" said Dr Tom Statler, the Dart programme scientist at Nasa.  . \"We've had to develop software that can interpret images taken by the spacecraft, figure out what is the right target and make the course correction manoeuvres by firing thrusters.\". Dart will be returning images to Earth at the rate of one per second as it heads towards its \"deep impact\". What at first will appear as a dot of light in the pictures will quickly grow to fill the entire field of view, before the feed then suddenly cuts out as the spacecraft is destroyed. Fortunately, that's not the end of the story. Dart has carried with it a 14kg Italian cubesat that was released some days ago. Its job is to record what happens when Dart digs out a crater. . Its pictures, snapped from the safe distance of 50km, will be beamed back to Earth over the coming days. \"LiciaCube will pass about three minutes after Dart's impact,\" said Simone Pirrotta from the Italian space agency (ASI). \"This timing has been selected in order to allow the plume of ejecta to be completely developed, because one of the major contributions of LiciaCube is to document the plume to support the measurement of the parameters that confirm the deflection of the orbit.\". Currently, Dimorphos takes roughly 11 hours and 55 minutes to circle Didymos. The impact is expected to change the smaller object's momentum such that the orbital period is reduced to something in the order of 11 hours and 45 minutes. Telescope measurements will confirm this in the weeks and months ahead. Surveys of the sky combined with statistical analyses suggest we have identified more than 95% of the monster asteroids that could initiate a global extinction were they to collide with Earth (they won't; their paths have been computed and they won't come near our planet). But this still leaves many so-far undetected smaller objects that could create havoc, if only on the regional or city scale. . An object like Dimorphos, were it to hit Earth (it won't), . might dig out a crater perhaps 1km across.  and a couple of hundred meters deep. The damage in the vicinity of the impact would be intense. Four years from now, the European Space Agency (Esa) will have three spacecraft - collectively known as the Hera mission - at Didymos and Dimorphos to make follow-up studies."},

{"a": "A major overhaul of farm subsidies that rewards landowners in England for their environmental work is in doubt after the government signalled a review. Environmental groups and some farmers worry the government could water down the overhaul, known as environmental land management schemes (ELMS), but the NFU farm union had requested a delay. ELMS is designed to replace the EU's common agricultural policy (CAP). A government spokesperson confirmed it was \"rapidly reviewing\" its plans. ELMS.  was the biggest shake-up of farm policy in England for 40 years, introduced after Brexit to replace the EU's CAP payouts. . Those grants were worth about \u00a33.5bn annually and the majority were paid based on how much land each individual farmer owned, leading to criticisms that the payments benefited the wealthiest. The new ELMS subsidy framework was cast into doubt after a number of landowners and farmers had meetings about the scheme with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs cancelled. News of the review prompted an unusually outspoken statement from the director-general of the National Trust, Hilary McGrady. \"Rather than ramp up action to support our environment, this government appears however to be heading in the opposite direction,\" she said. Cambridgeshire farmer Martin Lines, who is chairman of the Nature Friendly Farming Network, which promotes sustainable farming, said that any delay to the ELMS scheme would deny farmers crucial support to adapt to a changing climate. . \"If the government is stalling ELMS, it is failing any duty of leadership in maintaining momentum and building resilience,\" he said. ELMS is made up of three payment schemes - the sustainable farming incentive, local nature recovery and landscape recovery. Under the system, farmers could be paid subsidies based on a range of environmental work, from improving water and soil health and creating wildlife habitats to rewilding whole landscapes. But those with smaller farms had voiced concerns that the new nature-friendly system would not offer them enough to stay in business. NFU president Minette Batters said her organisation had wanted a delay to the schemes' introduction. \"We called for a delay not because we wanted to hang on to the status quo but because we believe that the SFI needed to have more detail and it needs to be profitable,\" she said. \"We have always been calling for a better policy, one that does deliver for food production and for the environment.\". She also argued that the larger-scale rewilding projects should be paid for with private money, not public funds. \"We have got literally billions and billions of pounds in green finance that is looking to invest in wild environments. We should be making the private sector work effectively,\" she said. . A.  report . earlier this year by think tank the Green Alliance estimated that delaying ELMS by two years would reduce the savings in agricultural emissions delivered by 2035 by half. News of the review triggered warnings from environmental groups. Craig Bennett, chief executive of The Wildlife Trusts, said \"If we revert to an agricultural system where people get given taxpayers' money on the basis of how much land they own then one of the few potential benefits of Brexit will have been squandered. It will be unfair and unsustainable.\". Richard Benwell, chief executive of Wildlife and Countryside Link, a coalition of rural conservation charities, said: \"Farmers should be paid more and paid well for ambitious action to deliver environmental recovery, alongside producing healthy food.\". He said any suggestion farmers be paid based on the amount of land they owned \"would squander years of work and waste the opportunity to create a thriving agriculture sector that works in harmony with nature. Area-based payments are inefficient and inequitable\". . A Defra spokeswoman said that, while environmental land management remained important, the department was reviewing its plans \"given the pressures on farmers, and the government's aims of boosting food security and economic growth\". . She added: \"In the light of the current global economic situation, we know that the cost of inputs has gone up, which might make it more difficult for farmers to both improve the natural environment and underpin food production, so we will continue our engagement with the sector to make sure the outcomes that the British people want to see are delivered.\". Agricultural policy in the UK is a devolved responsibility and each nation is implementing its own subsidy schemes."},

{"a": "The chair of an influential parliamentary committee has called for an investigation into an arts festival that has cost taxpayers \u00a3120m. Unboxed was announced in 2018 by then Prime Minister Theresa May and was soon dubbed the Festival of Brexit. In a letter to the National Audit Office (NAO), Conservative MP Julian Knight called it an \"excessive waste of money during a cost of living crisis\". But Unboxed chief Martin Green said it was \"absolutely value for money\". Unboxed is an ongoing project that describes itself as a \"once-in-a-lifetime celebration of creativity across the UK\". Ahead of the opening of See Monster, the latest Unboxed venture that has seen an old North Sea gas platform installed in a former lido in Weston-super-Mare, Mr Green told the BBC it was a \"big and bold and ambitious\" programme. He claimed Unboxed had done \"exactly what the government asked us to do\", with a legacy of investment in jobs during the pandemic and pioneering creativity that will endure. But in his letter, Mr Knight called the festival a \"fiasco in the making\". Speaking to the BBC, he said \"questions need to be answered about how this was allowed to happen\". He added: \"These decisions are signed off by politicians so therefore politicians need to take the blame.\". At \u00a3120m, Unboxed cost four times what the taxpayer spent on the Platinum Jubilee. Even before it opened, a report from Mr Knight's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee deemed it \"an irresponsible use of public money\" and a \"recipe for failure\". His letter to the NAO, the UK's independent public spending watchdog, has increased the pressure on the festival. \"I'm calling for an NAO investigation to ensure we see what has happened, why it is that this money has been spent in this way and then we also learn the lessons for the future,\" he said. \"We saw the warning signs\u2026 and the fact is this has been potentially a monumental waste of money and has had little impact in the country as a whole.\". Unboxed organisers have not yet released official visitor numbers, but Mr Green told me they will do so once they are verified later next month. A report in parliament's The House magazine in August claimed 238,000 people had visited, a fraction of the ambitious \"stretch target\" of 66 million the festival had suggested might get involved. The article said the the government had released figures for four Unboxed events. It said 120,000 people had watched the opening project About Us, while had 60,000 walked the trails in Northern Ireland and Cambridge of Our Place in Space, a journey through the solar system. . Another 14,000 reportedly attended the kaleidoscopic experience Dreammachine, and 44,000 went to Dandelion, a grow-your-own food initiative across Scotland. At the time, Mr Knight said his committee had sounded the alarm about a project \"with such a vague vision and nebulous name\" which \"seemed doomed to failure\". The lack of interest from the public was a \"damning indictment\", he said. However, Mr Green told me the 238,000 figure was incorrect and applied to eight individual events of the \"hundreds we have done in hundreds of places\".  . He claimed that \"millions\" of people had engaged with Unboxed in person, and that he was \"very confident\" the festival would hit its visitor targets. He said the Our Place in Space project had achieved 300,000 in-person engagements and 200,000 digitally. He added that the 66 million stretch target included everyone visiting in person; seeing it, for example on a forthcoming episode of BBC One's Countryfile; and \"anyone who engages with it digitally and sees it around the world\". Mr Green isn't used to sustained criticism. The enthusiastic chief creative officer of Unboxed has many successes to trumpet, not least the celebrated 2012 Olympic ceremonies and Hull's year as City of Culture in 2017. But critics say it would have been better if Unboxed had been left in its box. The festival's latest venture, See Monster, is an art installation and a conversation about the environment. The 35m (115ft) structure looms over the beach at Weston and consists of a series of yellow steel-framed platforms that were once used to extract gas from deep in the North Sea. A waterfall gushes from one of its levels, mist creates a cloud formation on another, and the platform is covered in plants that are watered by wind and solar power generated on the structure itself. It's the ninth of 10 Unboxed projects that have taken place around the UK in what is termed a coming together of science, technology, engineering, the arts and maths. As he showed me around the rig ahead of its opening on Saturday, Mr Green said the point of See Monster was \"to take something that took from the earth and ask it to give back\". For the first time, he said, a rig has been repurposed instead of scrapped, and British expertise will be shared across the world. On the seafront in Weston, with the rig now an obvious landmark until November, most of the passers-by I spoke to had never heard of Unboxed. They were more positive about See Monster, which had been due to open to visitors earlier in the summer, but was delayed.  . Local pensioner Mike Petrie said he was \"really impressed\" by the structure, though \"a bit disappointed for all the holiday makers and all the school children who missed it\". Another resident of the North Somerset town, Jan Brady, thought See Monster was \"wonderful\".  She said she had tried to visit a few times but understood \"with projects of this size, with what we've all been through, delays happen\". . Lucy West, on holiday with her husband from Oxfordshire, said she would \"like to see them repurpose it and continue using it after all the money that's been poured into it\". See Monster creative director Patrick O'Mahony's company Newsubstance was also behind the celebrated drones that formed the lit-up corgi above Buckingham Palace for the Platinum Jubilee. Mr O'Mahony told me the team had to navigate legislative and technical hurdles to get the platform to Weston and it was \"always going to be difficult\".  . \"We are slightly later than we hoped for, but we are here,\" he said. \"We are the first people in the world ever to take a structure like this and use it for arts and culture.\". Unboxed will continue for another two months, and while the festival may be coming under political pressure, many will be reluctant to judge the project's success or failure until after it has concluded in November."},

{"a": "US author Jodi Picoult says Broadway wouldn't stage her new musical version of Markus Zusak's beloved novel The Book Thief. So it his having its world premiere in Bolton instead. For years, Picoult has watched her books be adapted for the stage and screen by other people, not always with happy results. So she felt some extra responsibility after Zusak agreed to let her turn his 2005 bestseller about a young girl in Nazi Germany into a theatre musical. \"Part of what I said to Markus, when I was pitching him this idea is, 'Look, I just went through this process with my own work,'\" she says. \"'I will take care of your baby, because I know what it feels like.'. \"And because of that, I feel like I have an added responsibility to be true to the story and the message and the emotions that he created in his beautiful novel.\". She adds: \"There is no small part of me that is terrified because he's flying here from Australia to see the production.\". Picoult has made a long journey herself, temporarily relocating from New Hampshire to Bolton, Greater Manchester, for rehearsals and the show's opening this week. She made her name by writing almost 30 novels, the last dozen of which have gone in at number one on the New York Times bestseller list. Five have been made into movies, with four more in development. In 2009, Cameron Diaz starred in a film of her 2004 novel My Sister's Keeper. However, Picoult was not happy when the ending was changed without her knowledge. \"When you adapt for a different format, there are changes that have to happen,\" she says. \"And they hopefully are made without compromising the quality or the message of the story that was originally told in book format. \"As someone who has had an experience where that didn't happen, where I did see my story compromised on film, I'm really sensitive to making sure that even if a change is made, or if something is altered in the story that we tell on the stage, it is for a reason that will eventually bring you around to the same feelings and energy that the novel has.\". Picoult has recently thrown herself into the world of musicals. She was part of a team that adapted one of her own books, Between the Lines, which has just finished an off-Broadway run. She worked on that show with playwright Timothy Allen McDonald and songwriters Elyssa Samsel and Kate Anderson, who penned tunes for Disney's Olaf's Frozen Adventure and Apple TV's Central Park. But its preparations were ravaged by Covid, and . Picoult has blamed.  a decision to cut its run short on a post-pandemic reluctance for audiences across the theatre industry to book tickets in advance. She and her co-creators wanted to work together again. \"I wanted to try something different, because it's more of a challenge for me to adapt a story that isn't mine,\" she says. All four wrote wish lists of other novels they would like to adapt. Everyone put down The Book Thief. \"It is a story that sticks with people,\" Picoult says. \"It's one of those books that I read and thought, God, why didn't I write that?\". That's not the only reason she was keen to stage it. The Book Thief follows Liesel, who discovers the power of words, not only to heal her own wounds, but also to be used by those in power to divide or silence. It depicts the burning of books by Nazis in 1933. Picoult worries that such threats will not stay in the distant past. She says her books have been banned by school districts in five US states in recent years. Most object to her 2007 novel Nineteen Minutes, about a school shooting - although it is a page depicting a rape that they find objectionable, she says. Last week, the American Library Association said attempts to ban books are accelerating at a rate not seen since tracking began more than 20 years ago, . according to The New York Times. . The Book Thief \"is a story about what is happening to us now in our world\", Picoult believes. \"It's a cautionary tale. \"And for us, we're four Americans who have seen a rise to power of an administration that sought to divide America rather than unite it, that leaned into the ideas of lying, of calling the press fake news, of calling immigrants the enemy of the state, of banning books... I mean, my God, all of this is literally in the pages of The Book Thief. \"So for us, it felt very, very current.\" . Picoult struggled to get Broadway producers on board - not because of its subject matter, but because they just weren't familiar with the book, she says. \"To be brutally honest, when we began pitching this to people in the United States, most people had not heard of the book, and that shocked me,\" she explains. The book particularly appealed to teenage readers. \"In America right now, the gatekeepers of Broadway are a very small group of mostly older white men who are making the decisions about what comes to Broadway and what does not. They like to see shows that reflect their own experience.\". The Book Thief novel was better known in the UK, and Bolton Octagon theatre artistic director Lotte Wakeham already held it close to her heart. Two of its main characters are called Liesel and Max. By coincidence, Wakeham's own brother and sister are Max and Ellen Liesel, named after her great grandfather and great aunt, Hungarian Jews who survived the Holocaust. \"So the story and themes of The Book Thief have always had a very special resonance to me,\" she says. McDonald knew of Wakeham through her past work as associate director of Matilda The Musical, and she jumped at the offer to direct the show. US producers are also reluctant to take a risk on new shows, Picoult says. \"It is honestly not a good time to develop new musicals in America\", the author adds. It may be the case, of course, that the gatekeepers were less willing to take a risk on The Book Thief after Between the Lines got mixed reviews, with . the New York Times calling it \"sweet but uneven\".  and . Time Out saying it had \"a lot of clich\u00e9s and stock characters\". . But Picoult believes \"the Broadway system is a little broken\". She continues: \"Having had all the struggles that we had to launch the musical that was off Broadway this July, Between the Lines, we didn't want to go through that again. \"And the UK has, I think, a much more generous system for creating new musicals and new content. And for all those reasons, it seemed like a good fit.\". The Book Thief is at the Bolton Octagon theatre until 15 October."},

But I think [Craig] will be dreadful,\" she jokes. The singer says Strictly training is very different to prepping performances as a solo artist. \"The biggest hindrance... is we're not told [as solo performers] 'you must put your foot there, leave it there. You must move this way. You must do this.' The reason we didn't want proper jobs is because we don't like to be told what to do on stage. And when you do it for so long, it's a hard habit to break. So you're attempting to move in a certain way [in training] but you are strictly regimented with that choreography.\". Matt is back home in the UK after 11 years as a headliner in Las Vegas but says he \"wasn't happy at the end.

The Paralympic swimming star has been finding her feet both on set and behind the scenes. \"With [having] dwarfism, I was able to go down to the studio just to make sure that things can work for me, even something simple like they've given me lower rails so I can put my outfits on. We get physio support and psychology support, too. She says she and her [yet to be announced] dance partner will be learning together. \"He's never danced with anyone with dwarfism before.

I'm definitely a little bit more nervous than I was when I was little. . \"Because I've had Simon [Cowell as a judge], am I scared of Craig?

Fleur is feeling the strain already - she was two hours late to her radio breakfast show after the first day of filming. \"I'm sorry I let you down but I was just shimmying and shaking to the wee hours and it knocked me out!\" she told her listeners on Hits Radio. You'll get used to it, Fleur. \"I was nervous about the lifts because although I go to the gym and\u2026 I feel quite physically strong, this is completely different,\" he says. \"Doing that [a lift] after a whole minute running around the dance floor is mad!\".

The representation is there.\". James Bye, who plays Martin Fowler in EastEnders, says he doesn't feel any pressure after his co-star Rose Ayling-Ellis won Strictly last year. . \"I'm not a very competitive person. So as long as I beat Rose, I'm not bothered!\" he laughs. James is one of a long line of EastEnders actors to take part so who else would he like to see give it a go?. \"I would love Lacey (Turner) to do it. I don't know if she would, but I think she would be fantastic. Or Steve McFadden. I think Phil Mitchell in sequins would be the ultimate!\". \"I think the nice thing for me about this is\u2026 normally I'm on my own, it's just the nature of my work,\" the former Blue Peter presenter says. \"I went to Antarctica [for Sport Relief], they intentionally got a non-English speaking sound man because they wanted me to be on my own, like a real explorer.

Nearly 250 episodes of Fortunately with Fi and Jane have been released since the weekly podcast launched. . Intended as a look behind the scenes of broadcasting, the format sees the pair interview a variety of guests and discuss topics sent in by listeners. . It was . the third most downloaded podcast.  on BBC Sounds in 2021, behind Newscast and You're Dead to Me. Garvey and Glover's chemistry and self-deprecating humour have been applauded by listeners, and the pair have been praised for their open discussions of sometimes taboo subjects. Garvey has had a long career with the BBC and was the first voice heard on Radio 5 Live when the station launched in 1994. She later presented Radio 4's Woman's Hour for 13 years, alternating with Dame Jenni Murray, until both departed in 2020. Glover started her BBC career in local radio and also went on to present a variety of programmes on 5 Live. She also fronted several shows for Radio 4, including The Listening Project and Two Rooms. Speaking to the Times.  as the newspaper announced its sister radio station's latest recruits, Glover said: \"We're not leaving Fortunately in a massive strop, but we have talked about ourselves as much as we want to, and we found the offer of a return to solid journalism appealing. \"I listen to way more stuff outside the BBC than I ever thought would be possible to find, so [Times Radio] feels like a familiar world to my ears, if not to my head.\". Garvey said the BBC was currently losing \"more experienced\" staff. \"There's never been a time where people haven't been gloomy about the BBC, though,\" she said. \"I've moaned and groaned about my employer for 34 years, but I've also had some astonishing opportunities.\" ."},

{"a": "Carbon emissions in the Amazon region in 2019 and 2020 more than doubled compared to the average of the previous eight years, according to a new study. Deforestation for agriculture and fires were the main drivers of the increase, according to the authors. . The scientists say that a \"collapse\" in law enforcement in recent years has encouraged forest clearing. . The research findings have been submitted for publication but have yet to be independently reviewed. . As home to the largest tropical forest on Earth, the Amazon plays a critical role in maintaining the Earth's climate by storing massive amounts of carbon in trees and soils. Over the last few decades the forest has been under growing pressure as land has been cleared in Brazil and neighbouring countries, primarily for farming. . Last year . researchers published data.  indicating that the eastern part of the forest was being cut down at such a rate that more carbon was being released than absorbed by the trees and vegetation. . Now the same scientists believe that an explosion of forest clearing in the western part of the Amazon has also turned that region into a source. of carbon emissions . Using small planes, the researchers have collected hundreds of air samples from different parts of the forest over the last ten years. . Their new study shows that in 2019, carbon emissions increased by 89% compared to the annual average of emissions between 2010 and 2018. In 2020, the picture was even worse, with an increase of 122%. . While fires played a role, the main factor was the removal of trees by land clearing, which increased by 75% in 2020. . The researchers link this rise in deforestation to a rapid decline in prosecutions by law enforcement agencies, which saw fines for illegal forest clearances fall by 89% in 2020. The scientists say that this is down to the policies of President Jair Bolsonaro, who took office in 2019. He has cancelled fines and penalties related to deforestation, and pushed hard for the expansion of agriculture in Brazil. . \"We hypothesize that the consequences of the collapse in enforcement led to increases in deforestation, biomass burning and degradation producing net carbon losses and enhancing drying and warming of forest regions,\" the new study says. . The researchers say that this rapid increase in emissions from the forest has also had an impact on the climate around the trees. . \"In consequence of this big deforestation, in the wet season of 2020 we saw a decline of 26% in rainfall during January, February and March, while the temperature has gone up by 0.6C,\" said lead author Dr Luciana Gatti, from Brazil's National Institute for Space Research (INPE). \"The emissions come from deforestation and degradation and also from this climate change promoted by the human destruction of the forest. And this is a very alarming scenario,\" she told BBC News. . Environmental campaigners say that this hands-off approach to prosecuting illegal deforestation has continued this year, with over 8,500 sq km lost between August 2021 and July 2022, an area larger than the US state of Delaware. \"The collapse in law enforcement in the Brazilian Amazon has allowed land grabbers and illegal loggers to continue unchecked with devastating consequences for people, wildlife and the planet,\" said Mike Barrett from WWF. \"The Amazon is getting dangerously close to a crucial tipping point which could see large areas transform from a resilient, moist rainforest into a dry, fire-ravaged, and irreversibly degraded state.\". The question of the future of the forest is an important issue in . Brazil's presidential election.  taking place in early October with the incumbent, Jair Bolsonaro, being challenged by former president Luiz In\u00e1cio \"Lula\" da Silva. The outcome could have significant implications for the Amazon, as scientists like Dr Gatti fear it may be reaching a point where it would continually emit more carbon than it absorbs. . She said that action by consumers and governments around the world was also critical to prevent this from happening. . \"We need to have an international commitment with countries in international commerce, that they don't buy the products that result in the destruction of nature,\" she said.

Artemis I Moon rocket was expected to launch from the Kennedy Space Center, in Florida, on Tuesday. . But the US state faces a hurricane threat as tropical storm Ian has strengthened and could approach Florida early next week as a major hurricane. The launch of the rocket had already been postponed twice. . The Space Launch System (SLS) vehicle is designed to send astronauts and their equipment back to the Moon after an absence of 50 years. . Its first launch . failed at the end of August.  due to technical glitches, while a second attempt at the start of September.  was hampered by a fuel leak. . A decision on whether to return the rocket to its assembly site is due to be taken by the Artemis I team on Sunday. . This would be \"to allow for additional data gathering and analysis\", NASA said. The space agency wants to send the unmanned capsule Orion around the back of the Moon, ahead of journeys with humans aboard. Nasa hopes that by 2025 it will be able to send astronauts back to the lunar surface. If the SLS will have to be shielded, it will miss the current launch window, which ends on 4 October. . Jim Free, associate administrator for the agency's exploration systems development directorate, said that a \"step-wise approach\" to the decision to roll back preserved a launch opportunity if conditions improved. . On Saturday, Ian strengthened as it moved over the Caribbean. Its projected path takes it just south of Jamaica, over western Cuba and into Florida, the hurricane centre said. Florida Keys and South Florida could be hit by heavy rains on Monday, according to forecasters."},

{"a": "The cost-of-living crisis is hitting people living in rural areas harder than those living in towns and cities, according to a new report. . The study,.  by the Rural Services Network, says those in the countryside are spending much more on essentials like heating, transport and housing. Facing \"significantly higher\" costs, they earn \"much less\" than their urban counterparts, the report found. Since the pandemic, house prices have also soared in comparison to towns. . The study found that rural house prices are almost 40% higher than in urban areas across England (excluding London), with rural villages and hamlets increasing to 55% higher. Meanwhile, rural households on a low income now spend about half of their earnings on rent - almost 5% more than low-income households in urban areas. Houses in the countryside also tend to cost a lot more to heat, as many are less well-insulated and are not connected to the gas grid. . The research shows that rural households need more than \u00a3500 to take them out of fuel poverty, which is twice as much as in urban areas. The cost of getting around is also higher, as an estimated . 3,000 rural bus routes . have been \"lost or reduced\" in a decade, according to the Campaign for Better Transport. . Because of a greater reliance on cars, the data shows that rural households spend on average about \u00a3114 per week on transport, compared to \u00a380 for urban households. This eats into a higher proportion of disposable income. . Despite these higher costs, rural employees with the lowest earnings face wages 12% lower than those working in urban areas. . Graham Biggs, chief executive of the Rural Services Network, which represents rural councils and other service providers, said: \"Outdated infrastructure and a legacy of other factors, such as poor transport and broadband connectivity, employment opportunities and housing demand, means that many rural areas are more isolated than maps suggest and are all contributing to a higher overall cost of living. \"The government must overcome policy silos and develop an integrated approach that recognises the multiple forms of disadvantage rural areas face. . \"This should include levelling up the rural economy to ensure that low wage levels can be improved, as well as supporting rural houses to become more energy efficient to help get families out of fuel poverty.\". A government spokesperson said: \"We know people are worried about their energy bills which is why today we have announced further details of the Energy Price Guarantee, which will save the average household \u00a31,000 a year based on current energy prices from October. \"The government will continue to support rural areas in navigating the months ahead, including the action we have taken to help farmers like bringing forward 50% of the Basic Payment Scheme funding, reducing employer national insurance and slashing fuel duty.\".

{"a": "The government has confirmed it is ending the ban in the UK on . fracking. , a controversial technique that involves drilling and using liquids at high pressure to release shale gas. . In her first speech as prime minister, Liz Truss said: \"We will get spades in the ground to make sure people are not facing unaffordable energy bills.\". She has pledged to increase domestic energy production with more oil and gas from the North Sea as well as fracking. And the new Business and Energy Secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg told MPs on 22 September: \"We also need more secure and cheaper supplies of gas, which is why we are going to issue more licences and why we are looking at shale gas.\". He has said the government expects to award \"more than 100 new licences\" for oil and gas exploration in the North Sea. . But there have been warnings that these measures will not reduce people's energy bills in the short-term. \"Greater domestic production of fossil fuels may improve energy security,\" the heads of the Climate Change Committee and the National Infrastructure Commission warned . in a letter to the prime minister. . \"But our gas reserves - offshore or from shale - are too small to impact meaningfully the prices faced by UK consumers.\" . Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer also referred in Parliament to some \"myth-busting\" . tweets from Greg Hands.  in February when Mr Hands was energy minister. . The tweet said it was a myth that extracting more North Sea gas lowers prices on the grounds that \"UK production isn't large enough to materially impact the global price of gas\". . Kwasi Kwarteng, who is now chancellor, also . tweeted in February.  saying: \"additional North Sea production won't materially affect the wholesale price (certainly not anytime soon)\". . Fundamentally, UK energy companies buy gas - including from the North Sea - on the international market where prices are set by global supply and demand. The amount extra that could be extracted from the North Sea - or from fracking - is unlikely to be enough to bring down bills significantly unless the government agrees a price with the companies that extract it. . The government has said it will look at . new long-term energy contracts . with domestic and international gas suppliers, although they create a danger of being tied into prices that are above market levels in the future. There are also questions about how long it would take for any extra gas to be available. Prof Jonathan Stern from the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies says: \"The main issue is that if you started drilling tomorrow, had success the day after and everything else went to plan, it would still be two to four years before you could produce enough gas to make a difference to UK output.\". While . government estimates.  suggest there is still a significant amount of oil and gas under the North Sea, Prof Stern says that most of that is now in deep water, far from shore, which means it takes even longer to bring it online.  . Reversing the ban on fracking does not present an easy, quick answer to high energy bills either. Prof Stern said research 10 years ago had concluded that fracking wasn't viable in Europe and that was still the case. \"The problem is you don't know if you have a worthwhile resource until you've dug 50 to 100 wells, and that's a huge problem in Europe.\" . That is because Europe is generally more crowded and land is more expensive than in the US, where fracking has extracted considerable quantities of gas and kept down domestic energy prices. \"The US infrastructure for export is relatively limited, so they can only export a small proportion of what they're producing,\" said Kathryn Porter, an energy consultant at Watt-Logic. . That makes it harder for US companies to sell their gas outside the country, which keeps the domestic price much lower. . But the boss of the fracking company Cuadrilla welcomed the lifting of the moratorium, saying: \"This is an entirely sensible decision and recognises that maximizing the UK's domestic energy supply is vital if we are going to overcome the ongoing energy crisis and reduce the risk of it recurring in the future.\" . New onshore wind energy could come online faster than gas. The European Wind Energy Association . says that.  a small wind farm can be built in as little as two months, once planning permission has been granted. . But a bigger farm that needed infrastructure such as new roads . could take closer to two years. . And the planning permission process can take two or three years. During the leadership campaign Liz Truss indicated that she favours other forms of generation over onshore wind, but Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng has just announced the planning process to install turbines will be made easier. The CCC and NIC recommend a range of policies such as greater energy efficiency in buildings and better energy advice for consumers.  . Some analysts have suggested that the solution is to . separate electricity prices from gas prices.  by allowing households to have long-term contracts with renewable electricity generators.

Former colleagues and fans paid tribute to the actress, calling her an \"absolute great\". . Fletcher was a relative unknown when picked to play Nurse Ratched in 1975's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. She began her acting career in the 50s but paused for more than a decade to raise her children. . Leading actresses including Angela Lansbury and Ellen Burstyn had all turned down the part. . Set and filmed in a psychiatric hospital in Oregon in the US,  One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was directed by Milos Forman and based on Ken Kesey's 1962 novel of the same name. . The film proved hugely popular, winning a raft of awards and making it into many lists of the greatest American films of all time. . Central to the film's appeal was Fletcher's cruel and calculating Nurse Ratched, a fearsome symbol of institutional authority who is pitted against the individualism of Jack Nicholson's Randle McMurphy. The American Film Institute put Nurse Ratched behind only The Wicked Witch of the West, Darth Vadar, Norman Bates and Hannibal Lecter . in its ranking of film's greatest villains. . Fletcher won an Oscar in 1976 for her role, part of a rare clean sweep that saw the film also bag Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Screenplay. .

{"a": "What do you think of, when you think of John Legend? . To some, he's the Kanye West prot\u00e9g\u00e9 who made good. To others, he's a Hollywood player, with credits on films like La La Land and Selma. Some will know he is the youngest ever (and first black American male) EGOT winner, earning an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony Award. But Legend is probably best-known for his ballads... and one ballad in particular. . All Of Me. , a swoonsome tribute to his wife, the model and chef Chrissy Teigen, has sold 3.6 million copies in the UK. On Spotify, and is approaching its 2 billionth play. Legend knows the success has pigeon-holed him. \"For a casual listener, they probably think I'm just a balladeer,\" he says. \"My albums have always had a hip-hop influence - but the ballads are the ones that have grabbed people by their hearts. \"When I was a management consultant, we used to call it a 'competitive advantage'. There's certain things a company does that they're better at than anybody else. And I think ballads are my competitive advantage.\". Legend had always been an over-achiever. . Born John Roger Stephens in Ohio, he began playing piano at the age of four, and was a spelling bee champion by 10. At school, he was so academically gifted that he skipped two grades, and left home at 16 to study English at the University of Pennsylvania. There, he became president of the university a-capella group, and was tapped by Lauryn Hill to play on her hit single Everything Is Everything. He assumed he was on the path to stardom, but he was wrong... at least for a couple of years. \"There was a lot of rejection.\" he says, \"but if I'd got a record deal at 18, I would have screwed it up\". \"I didn't know what went into being a successful solo artist. I just thought, 'Oh, I can sing and I'm writing some decent songs,' but there's more to it than that. . \"I'm a coach on The Voice now and that's something I'm always thinking about when I'm advising the artists. They're all really good singers - some of them are much better singers than I am - but the only way for them to make it is to have a point of view that's interesting and distinct and personal. . \"Music is not just a virtuosity competition.\". Those early rejections explain how Legend spent three years as a management consultant, first in Boston, then in New York. . \"It's a demanding job, they expect you to work a decent number of hours,\" he recalls, \"but I was living a double life, writing at night, gigging at night. . \"People always ask me if I get tired now and I'm like, 'I get way more rest than I used to!'\". It was in New York that an old roommate first introduced him to Kanye West, then an up-and-coming artist himself. They immediately hit it off: West employed Legend to sing hooks on his demos, In return, he gave the musician beats for his songs. One of their collaborators, the poet J Ivy, noted that John's smooth, elastic vocals sounded \"like one of the legends\" - and West immediately rechristened his partner John Legend. At first, he was hesitant to adopt the name. \"I was like, 'Damn, what if I flop?' . \"And then my response to myself was, 'No, you're not going to flop. Bet on yourself. Go for it.'. \"I call it audacity. Kanye certainly had it, and has it. I think every successful artist has to have some audacity - to believe that what you have to offer to the world is unique and special, and deserves to be heard.\". West's first album, The College Dropout, arrived in 2004, with Legend featuring on seven tracks. By the end of the year Legend's own debut, Get Lifted, came out on West's GOOD Music label. \"The timing was exactly right,\" he reflects. \"The fact it happened after the College Dropout set me up perfectly.\". He's never looked back. He won the best new artist Grammy in 2006, scored his first platinum single with the 2008 shoe-shuffler . Green Light. , and in 2010 recorded a searing covers album full of still-relevant protest songs, called Wake Up. He met Teigen . on a video set.  and proposed at Christmas 2011 during a trip to the Maldives (the surprise was nearly ruined when airport security demanded to search his bag). . When he first played her All Of Me, she burst into tears... and his music still has the power to move her today. His new album, simply titled Legend, delicately dedicates two songs to Teigen and the baby she lost in 2020 as the result of a pregnancy complication. The couple had already named the unborn child Jack when it became apparent he would not survive. Teigen's life was also in danger. Diagnosed with partial placental abruption - where the placenta comes away from the inner wall of the womb - she was continually losing blood despite \"bags and bags of transfusions\". Eventually, the couple made the \". difficult and heartbreaking. \" decision to end the pregnancy. . \"That pain is never going to completely go away,\" Legend says. \"You're never exactly the same after you lose someone.\". Part of the healing process was a song called Stardust, in which Legend lifts up his wife, celebrating her strength and spirit despite their devastating loss. \"That was one of the earliest songs I wrote for the album, in the aftermath of losing our pregnancy, and it was really meaningful for Chrissy - because it was therapeutic after going through what we went through,\" he says. Another song, Pieces, is a raw but graceful piano ballad about navigating unimaginable grief. . \". The only thing you can do is pick up the pieces,\" . sings Legend. \". Let your broken heart learn to live in pieces. \". \"That whole section of the [album] is really about healing,\" he says. \"It's about figuring out a way to survive through your grief and remembering what you mean to the people that love you, and who you love.\". Legend says he and Teigen found their way through the darkness by focusing on their first two children, Luna and Miles. \"To have two little ones that we could dote on and nurture and enjoy... They bring us so much joy. . \"We just were able to hold each other through what was a very tough time.\". Teigen recently announced that she was pregnant again, after . \"one billion shots\".  of IVF - but Legend says the excitement is tempered by their previous experience. \"There's always this sense of cautious optimism, because you know what it's like to lose one,\" he says. \"And I think that's kind of the message of Pieces: You'll never forget that pain, but you'll find ways to keep going.\". Stardust and Pieces are just two of 24 tracks on Legend's epic eighth album. . Arranged over two discs, it's frontloaded with slinky dance tracks like Dope and All She Wanna Do Is Dance - on Strictly Come Dancing's launch show this week. Splish Splash is another ode to Teigen that, to put it politely, celebrates their marital relations with a cunning linguistic approach. What, I wonder, will their kids think?. \"You know, I make my music for grown-ups,\" he laughs. \"But at some point, they'll figure out what it means and they'll probably be embarrassed by it.\". The second half of Legend settles into a more comfortable neo-soul groove, full of songs about the healing power of love. Wonder Woman is an sparkling standout; as is . Good. , a duet with Ledisi, whose jazzy harmonies put some spice in Legend's step. \"Yeah, we definitely did that,\" he smiles. \"Sometimes we make the chord rub a little more. There's a little more dissonance, and the notes are crowded up together, instead of being evenly spread out. It feels really cool.\". Reviewers have largely preferred the first disc. . Rolling Stone said.  it was refreshing to see Legend shake off \"his usual supper-club decorum\", while . Pitchfork noted.  that collaborators like Rick Ross and Jazmine Sullivan helped the star \"bring more fun to his music than he has in years\". As J Ivy once observed, Legend's biggest skill is blending vintage and modern sounds - and this album contains traces of everyone from Prince and Marvin Gaye to Nina Simone and Nat King Cole, while the low-slung groove of You riffs on Curtis Mayfield's . Diamond In The Back. . Does he worry about referencing his influences after the notorious Blurred Lines copyright trial - where Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams were . successfully sued.  for copying the \"feel\" of Marvin Gaye's Got To Give It Up?. \"That was a terrible court decision,\" Legend says. \"Terrible for music. . \"It was not based on any real understanding of how songwriting works. Part of the creative process is having those influences and letting them inspire you to create something new. And if writers and producers aren't able to do that, then we're not really able to make music. . \"So I try not to let that creep into my head - but lawyers definitely let it creep in there, labels definitely let it creep in there. And I'm like, 'Leave me alone!'. \"I don't want to re-adjudicate that case... but it was a mess of a decision.\". He pauses. \"My lawyers are gonna be so mad I talked about that.\".

{"a": "\"An independent dance company, dedicated to bringing dance to the people,\" declares Birmingham's best-known gangster Tommy Shelby in an episode from series five of the hit TV series Peaky Blinders. Tommy is hosting a lavish birthday dinner at his country pile for his wife Lizzie with guests including fascist leader Oswald Mosley. The gang leader introduces a performance of Swan Lake featuring dancers from renowned company Rambert, which captivates the majority of the audience but sends his brother and partner in crime Arthur to sleep. Peaky Blinders creator Steven Knight is confident no-one will be dozing off during his latest venture, a real-life dance show called Peaky Blinders: The Redemption of Thomas Shelby, again in collaboration with Rambert, but on a much bigger scale. Having also worked with the London-based company on that TV episode and . 2019's Peaky Blinders festival. , Knight was keen to bring the dance experience to a new audience. \"I'm the least likely person to attend a dance show,\" he says. \"And yet the experience I've had watching rehearsals... is absolutely fantastic. I really want to get that message out there that if you think you don't like dance, come and see the show and you'll find out that you do. Anyone who likes Strictly can love this show.\". Knight explains that he wasn't a dance fan before Rambert got involved with the BBC TV series \"simply because I'd never been\", adding: \"It's like going to your first football match and you go 'oh wow, it's brilliant'.\". Dance critic Lyndsey Winship says it can be difficult to attract new audiences to dance because of preconceptions: \"So many people love to dance, or to watch dance on TV, but would never think of going to see a stage show. So something with a well-known title and story like Peaky Blinders is a good way of tempting them into the theatre. . \"In the popular imagination, dance is still so often associated with ballet and Swan Lake and fairy tales, but the contemporary dance scene is so much more than that, and it's great if people's eyes can be opened to that.\". The production begins as a prequel with the Shelby boys fighting in the trenches during World War One, but then it \"takes us through into a very familiar story, and it's not giving too much away to say it's about Tommy and Grace\", Knight explains. The pair's tragic romance will already be familiar to fans of the TV show. Rambert's artistic director Benoit Swan Pouffer is the creative lead behind the production and is keen to point out that his interpretation is not just focused on the machismo of the leading male characters. \"When the young men went to the war, who ran the world? Who was doing the labour and working? Women,\" he says. \"There's always a sense of that in the show. I wanted to put forward the strength of the woman as well. I have male and female and non-binary dancers.\". Much of the story is told through dance and staging with no dialogue other than some narration courtesy of Benjamin Zephaniah, who plays Jeremiah in the BBC One series. . \"It's a great challenge to try to tell a story without words. But fortunately, Benoit and Rambert are masters at it,\" Knight says. . \"And so what I did was put some things down on paper and then handed it over to Benoit, he's crafted it and changed it and made it what it is now.\". Pouffer adds that Knight \"was surprised that I asked him to write a script, but that was my blueprint. Once I had this it was easier to... create the show because I was anchored in a good way with his vision.\". I'm curious to know how challenging it was to cast such iconic characters that are known to millions, particularly Cillian Murphy's Tommy. \"It's not about the physical aspects\u2026 you really need to understand who those characters are,\" Pouffer tells me. . \"Who is Polly? Who is Jeremiah? Who is Arthur? Rambert is a company made up of individuals who can tell stories naturally and that was even before Peaky Blinders, so it was pretty easy to cast because I have strong personalities in the company. And it was very organic. \"Human beings are complex. Tommy Shelby is a complex man with a lot of layers of sensibility. He is not just a bandit. You understand the reason why he's acting that way, his struggle and his hurt,\" he continues. \"And through what Steven wrote us, it really pushes forward this dilemma that Tommy has in his head and in his life. Through the show, you will have this journey of understanding of what makes a Peaky Blinder and why Tommy Shelby has this redemption.\". Four young dancers from the company landed the lead roles - Seren Williams and Prince Lyons will share the parts of Tommy and Grace with Guillaume Queau and Naya Lovell. Williams says: \"We're not necessarily copying and pasting what you see in the series, we're taking the mindset of the characters\u2026 and translating that into movement, so there's still similarities between them.\". Lyons adds: \"We have a lead who is a white male and I'm clearly not a white male!. \"You are watching a different idea and it's kind of forcing you to view this world in a completely different light, the same way that a white Ariel [from The Little Mermaid] would look completely different to . the new Ariel that's coming out.  It's forcing you to use a bit of your imagination. \"The same way that if you were to read a book, if the author didn't fully describe what these characters look like, depending on who you are and who you grew up around, you make your own opinions based on what you've gone through and the culture around you.\". He adds: \"I just hope that audiences are able to view the beauty of our interpretation.\". Knight has three things he would like the audience to come away with. \"I want them to have had a fantastic evening. I want them to be quite emotional at the end of it. And for them to go away thinking dance is something that they enjoy.\". The show opens in Birmingham later this month. Knight smiles. \"It can't be anywhere else.\". Peaky Blinders: The Redemption of Thomas Shelby premieres at the Birmingham Hippodrome on 27 September followed by a run at Wembley Park ahead of a UK tour next year."},

{"a": "Nigerian writer Molara Wood pays tribute to author and filmmaker Biyi Bandele, whose film premiered in Canada weeks after his death. . Bandele's final film is an adaptation of Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka's play, Death and the King's Horseman. . It explores real-life events in the 1940s Oyo Kingdom in West Africa, in which the king's horseman was required by tradition to die by ritual suicide and follow the Alaafin (ruler of Oyo) into the afterlife. . Bandele, in a tragic twist, did not live to see the release of perhaps his most triumphant film, which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) in September, a month after the director's death at the age of just 54. He was buried in Nigeria's main city, Lagos, on Friday. Bandele's daughter, Temi, was in the Canadian city for the bittersweet showcase of the film, . described by Variety magazine as \"a passion project\" for the director. . . Paying tribute on Twitter, TIFF's chief executive officer Cameron Bailey said: \". Biyi Bandele was doing something so rare in world cinema. : large-scale adaptations of African literature meant for the whole world.\". An artist of many parts, Bandele, who lived in London, was a significant figure in the UK literary scene, and was also known for his achievements of the past decade in the Nigerian movie industry. . For several decades, he blazed his own path in a career marked by artistic virtuosity and reinvention. . \"I am first and foremost a writer,\" said Bandele, a prodigious talent who made his mark as a playwright, novelist, screenwriter, photographer and director. . His death in Lagos, Nigeria, on 7 August came not long after Netflix released the original limited series, Blood Sisters, which he co-directed, while he also had a new novel in the works. . News of his passing came in a Facebook post.  signed by his daughter, Temi, who described the death as \"unexpected,\" and praised her father as \"a storyteller to his bones, with an unblinking perspective, singular voice and wisdom, which spoke boldly through all of his art\". The news sent shockwaves through the African writing community, and among the literati in London. Bandele arrived in London in 1990 as winner of the International Student Playscript Competition. He was 22, until then a student of Obafemi Awolowo University in Ile-Ife, Nigeria. . Among 100 African writers who paid tribute in the online journal Brittle Paper.  was Nigerian author Richard Ali, who lauded Bandele's best-known book, Burma Boy, as \"one of the finest novels about WW2 that shows the peculiar experience of [African] soldiers\". In a post on Instagram, Booker Prize winner Bernardine Evaristo wrote: \"He was very much part of our arts community here in the UK and Nigeria. I always had huge respect for his prolific, super-talented and fearless creativity.\" . Bandele's agent Jessica Craig recalled her early encounter with Burma Boy: \"I was fascinated by the historical importance and authenticity, having never before known about Nigerian soldiers fighting in WWII for the British army.\" . She wondered why the book \"is not cherished as a classic of British and African literature\". Based on the war experience of Bandele's father, the novel was the first to explore the role of African soldiers in . the Burma Campaign, which saw Allied forces defeat Japanese troops. . . A worthy successor of the great Nigerian playwrights, including Soyinka and Femi Osofisan, Bandele was a precocious forerunner to the country's current literary stars. . He was a bridge between generations of Nigerian writing, literary genres and art forms, as well as African and Black British writing. . As fascinating as any character he ever created, the author was born Biyi Bandele-Thomas in 1967 in Nigeria's Kaduna state - in Kafanchan - a railway town that sounds like something from a fable. . \"I left when I was about 15, but it's defined every single aspect of my life,\" he said of his birthplace. . It was an imaginative childhood, spent listening to his mother's stories of gods and spirits - fantastical elements that would later infuse his work. . Visiting the local library with his father, he was drawn to a book about bicycles - the most common mode of transport in Kafanchan at the time. . The young Bandele became an avid reader, deciding by the age of seven that he wanted to tell stories. . He had his first short story published in a regional newspaper at the age of 12. He had written the first draft of what became his debut novel - The Man Who Came in From the Back of Beyond - by the time he was 14. The manuscript came with him to Britain after he won the playscript competition for Rain. . He published two more novels by the end of the 1990s, and styled his name, simply, as Biyi Bandele. . He wrote about a dozen plays, including Brixton Stories, Oronooko, and Marching for Fausa. . Over the span of a decade, he worked with the Royal Shakespeare Company, the Talawa Theatre Company, and the Bush Theatre. . His stage adaptation of Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart opened at the Royal Court Theatre in June 1997. Danny Boyle directed Bandele's first screenplay - Not Even God Is Wise Enough - about a day in the life of a Nigerian living in London. . His 1999 novel, The Street, is set in Brixton in south London, where he lived. He was a perceptive chronicler of the Black experience in Britain. . With Boyle's encouragement, Bandele went into filmmaking, adapting and directing Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's Half of a Yellow Sun, starring Thandiwe Newton, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Anika Noni Rose. . Beset with difficulties, the film nonetheless came together, shot on location in Nigeria, thanks to the doggedness of its director. . The new Soyinka adaptation is remarkable for Bandele's bold decision to return to the original Yoruba of the historical episode depicted. It is the first Yoruba language feature programmed at TIFF. . A notable feature of Bandele's Kafanchan childhood was a bar owned by his family, where he observed colourful, marginal characters up close, including sex workers and pickpockets. \"The most important thing that taught me was never to generalise about people, so that if you find prostitutes in my work, or you find thieves, they are first of all human before they are a type,\" . he told the BBC in 1998. . . Central to his work was the desire \"to have ordinary people reinvent their lives\". . Little wonder his photographs of ordinary people on Lagos Island have won plaudits for their warmth and the dignifying eye of his camera. Bandele's unpublished novel, Yoruba Boy Running, based on the life of the first African Anglican bishop of West Africa, Samuel Ajayi Crowther, was picked up by publisher Hamish Hamilton before the author's death. . The novel, along with his larger body of works, should be a fitting epitaph for the uniquely gifted talent that was Biyi Bandele."},

{"a": "Pop superstar Rihanna will headline the half-time show at February's Super Bowl in Arizona, the NFL has announced. . The nine-time Grammy winner broke the news by posting a photo of an NFL branded football to Twitter. . Organisers called the 34-year-old a \"generational talent\" in a press release issued on Sunday night. . The show is one of the most coveted slots in music, with this year's 14-minute spectacle drawing in more than 120 million viewers, the NFL said. The all-star line up included Dr Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J Blige and Kendrick Lamar. The show earned an Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Special (Live). . \"Rihanna is a once in a generation artist who has been a cultural force throughout her career,\" the NFL's head of Music Seth Dudowsky said. . And Jay-Z, whose Roc Nation entertainment company will  help organise the performance, called the star a \"woman of humble beginnings who has surpassed expectations at every turn\". . \"A person born on the small island of Barbados who became one of the most prominent artists ever. Self-made in business and entertainment,\" he added. . Rihanna's move marks a sharp about turn from the singer, who turned down an offer to headline the show in 2019 to show solidarity with the NFL star Colin Kaepernick. . A former starting quarterback with the San Francisco 49ers, Kaepernick hasn't played in the league since 2016 after his decision to kneel during the pre-game national anthem helped to launch a global movement against racism. . He later filed a lawsuit against the NFL, alleging that the leagues owner's were colluding to exile him from the sport. . Rihanna said at the time that she would have been an \"enabler\" if she had accepted the slot. . \"I just couldn't be a sell-out,\" she told Vogue magazine. \"There's things within that organisation that I do not agree with at all, and I was not about to go and be of service to them in any way.\". Earlier this week, US media reported that Taylor Swift had turned down an offer to headline the show, choosing instead to continue re-recording several albums. . Swift announced plans last year to re-release her first six albums to have complete control over her music. The move followed the 2019 acquisition of her master recordings by music mogul Scooter Braun and his subsequent sale of them to an investment fund."},

{"a": "King Charles III, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward follow the Queen's coffin as it is taken along the Royal Mile in Edinburgh from the Palace of Holyroodhouse to St Giles' Cathedral for a service of remembrance.  . On arrival at St Giles' Cathedral, pallbearers carried the coffin of Queen Elizabeth II, which was draped in the Royal Standard of Scotland. The coffin is made of English oak and lined with lead - a traditional design choice for members of the Royal Family. The Crown of Scotland was placed on the Queen's coffin during the service. Historically, the crown has been used in ceremonies to represent the sovereign's presence. It was placed on the coffin by Alexander Douglas-Hamilton, the 16th Duke of Hamilton, and it will remain there while thousands of people pay their respects. As well as the royals, the guest list included politicians, council officials, members of the armed forces, war veterans, judiciary and consular officials. There were also representatives from various Scottish charities of which the Queen was patron, and people involved in the arts, sports, emergency services and faith groups. Prime Minister Liz Truss was there - she'd also attended the morning events at Westminster Hall in London. Earlier in the day, King Charles III had inspected the Guard of Honour as he arrived for the Ceremony of the Keys at the Palace of Holyroodhouse. .  The monarch was presented with the keys of the city of Edinburgh. Well-wishers greeted the King in the garden area set aside for floral tributes to the late Queen outside the Palace of Holyroodhouse. The King met Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon at Edinburgh Airport after travelling from London with the Queen Consort. Thousands of people waited on the Royal Mile to watch as he and other royals joined a procession behind the Queen's coffin. In the morning King Charles was at Westminster Hall, which is where the Queen's coffin will lie in state later this week. At a ceremony the speakers from both Houses of Parliament - Sir Lindsay Hoyle and Lord McFall - addressed the King on behalf of MPs and peers. Ahead of the arrival of the monarch, about 900 MPs and peers, including Prime Minister Liz Truss and Labour leader Kier Starmer, gathered in the hall.  . Former prime minister Boris Johnson was also in attendance. A trumpet fanfare welcomed King Charles and the Queen Consort. Lord McFall of Alcluith welcomed the King and Queen Consort to Parliament. He said Queen Elizabeth II was both \"a leader to - and a servant of - the people\". He added that she possessed \"commitment, kindness, humour and courage, as well as the deep faith that was the anchor in her life\". Commons speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle said the loss of the Queen is felt across the UK and the entire Commonwealth, \"which she did so much to nurture\". . \"Deep as our grief is, we know yours is deeper,\" he added. Following his address, Sir Lindsay passed his speech to King Charles. . Replying, King Charles III said he could not help but feel the weight of history which surrounds those in Westminster Hall and which \"reminds us of vital Parliamentary traditions, to which MPs and peers dedicate themselves\". Following the ceremony, King Charles III and Camilla, the Queen Consort, flew to Edinburgh. All photographs subject to copyright. Latest updates as Queen's coffin travels to Edinburgh. What next?

{"a": "The Queen is lying in state in Westminster Hall after a procession from Buckingham Palace. Queen Elizabeth II's final departure from Buckingham Palace began at 14:22 BST, when the slow-moving procession departed her former home for Westminster Hall. The Queen's four children, led by King Charles, walked behind the coffin. Nearby, Big Ben tolled at 60-second intervals throughout the Queen's 38-minute journey to the Palace of Westminster. The coffin travelled down the Mall on a gun carriage of the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery, pulled by a team of horses bearing riders in ceremonial dress. The tree-lined boulevard, which cuts through the centre of London, has witnessed countless royal events over the years, including celebrations of the Platinum Jubilee earlier this year to mark the Queen's 70 years on the throne. Members of the public lined the Mall, many wiping away tears, some clapping and cheering, as the Queen's coffin passed by. The coffin was draped in the Royal Standard, representing the Sovereign and the UK, with the Imperial State Crown resting on top. The crown - placed on a purple cushion - features the St Edward's sapphire, Black Prince's Ruby and the Cullinan II diamond, cut from the largest diamond in the world. The coffin also bore a wreath of white roses and dahlias. King Charles III was joined by his sons, Prince William, now Prince of Wales, and Prince Harry, in the solemn procession. Other senior members of the Royal Family also took part. Up to 1,000 members of the armed forces took part in the procession, including the Household Cavalry - represented by the Life Guards and the Blues and Royals. King Charles III, his siblings Princess Anne and Prince Edward, and his son, the Prince of Wales, all wore military uniform. The King's brother, Prince Andrew, and his younger son, Prince Harry, both wore suits. Prince Harry is no longer a working member of the Royal Family, having taken a decision in 2020 to step back. Prince Andrew, too, is no longer a working royal. He lost his military titles earlier this year - shortly before he settled a civil sexual assault lawsuit in the US, in which he denied any wrongdoing. The Queen Consort, the Princess of Wales, the Duchess of Sussex and the Countess of Wessex all travelled from Buckingham Palace by car, joining the King at Westminster Hall for a short service following the procession. The procession moved along Horse Guards Parade and down Whitehall to arrive at Westminster Hall at 15:00 BST. Eight young men from the Grenadier Guards were entrusted with the task of carrying the Queen's coffin into the Palace of Westminster. Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to file past the coffin to pay their respects to the Queen over the next four days - with a huge policing operation in place. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex and the Prince and Princess of Wales. James, Viscount Severn, and Lady Louise Windsor. King Charles III stands, focused on the coffin. Earlier in the day, guards waited for the Queen's coffin to emerge from Buckingham Palace.

{"a": "A Russian police officer's takeaway food order was the breakthrough clue which helped a group of women, who had been terrorised by him, reveal his true identity. For the first time, a BBC investigation tells the story of how they tracked him down. The women, mostly aged between 19 and 25, had attended.  a rally in Moscow in March.  against Russia's invasion of Ukraine. They were quickly rounded up by officers and put in the back of a police van. . Most of them didn't know each other, but despite the circumstances the atmosphere was upbeat. They even set up a Telegram group chat as they travelled across the city to Brateyevo police station. What happened next was far worse than they anticipated. . Over the next six hours they suffered verbal and physical abuse that, in some cases, amounted to torture - one woman says she was repeatedly starved of oxygen when a plastic bag was put over her head. . The abuse was carried out by the same unnamed plain-clothes officer - tall, athletic, dressed in a black polo neck. In their group chat, they gave him the nickname the \"man in black\". . Two of the women, Marina and Alexandra, secretly recorded audio on their phones. In one, the officer can be heard shouting about his \"total impunity\". . But if his aim was to intimidate them into silence, he would fail. After their release, the women discussed on the Telegram group how they could work out who he was. . \"If we just kept on living like it didn't happen, if we just published the [recordings] and laid low\u2026 most likely, they would think they can do it again and that they would be completely unpunished,\" says 22-year-old student Marina. His image was seared in their memories, but they could find no sign of him on police websites. And with no name to go on, social media was a dead end. After more than a fortnight of searching, they were close to giving up. And then the women had a breakthrough. . In late March, there was a . massive data leak.  from the popular Russian food delivery app Yandex Food. The group had an idea. . They began raking through the data to see if there had been any orders to Brateyevo police station over the past year. They discovered there had - by nine different customers. Could one of them have been the \"man in black\"? . Most of the Yandex data only included first names and a phone number. The group of women used these to find several social media profiles for staff at the police station, but no photos resembled their interrogator. Finally they came to one of the last names on the list: Ivan. A popular Russian name, so one of the most difficult to pin down. Ivan's phone number, however, did reveal a trail online - six classified adverts from the Russian trading website Avito.ru. But most of the adverts only gave them the information they already knew - a first name. One, however - for a Skoda Rapid car sold 10 minutes' drive from Brateyevo police station, posted in 2018 - included the seller's full name: Ivan Ryabov. . With a surname, they could search for a picture. And almost immediately, 19-year-old Anastasia came across one she recognised. \"I started crying. I could not believe\u2026 that I managed to do it.\". She sent the picture to Marina, Alexandra, and others in the Telegram group, who agreed they had found their \"man in black\". They hope this will finally prompt the authorities to open a criminal investigation. The audio recordings give a chilling insight into the women's abuse. . Ryabov can be heard telling Marina to answer his questions before \"I take off my boot and smash you on the head with it.\"  . For 14 minutes, Marina says she was shouted at and kicked by Ryabov - a pistol in her face. Finding My Torturer. BBC Eye Investigations tells the story of how these young Russian women came together to expose the identity of their torturer and his commanding officer. Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only). Anastasia, waiting outside, remembers hearing the sound of screaming and blows. When she, too, refused to co-operate with the questioning, she says Ryabov beat her over the head with a water bottle, emptied its contents over her, and then pulled a plastic bag over her soaking head where he held it against her nose and mouth for 30-40 seconds at a time. . \"You think to yourself - how much longer can I take this?\" she says. Alexandra, 26, also managed to record her abuse, and in her audio we hear Ryabov boast of his total impunity. \"You think we're going to get in trouble for this? Putin told us to kill all of [your type]. That's it! Putin's on our side!\". He then threatens to kill her himself, adding: \"And then they'll give me a bonus for it too.\". At least 11 of the detainees say they experienced physical abuse at the hands of the \"man in black\". When the women publicly released the audio recorded on their phones earlier this year, one Russian politician called for action - but the country's Investigative Committee deemed there to be \"insufficient evidence\" to warrant opening a criminal investigation into the case. The women also wanted to know who had authority over Ryabov that day - and why that person wasn't stopped. Anastasia had always felt another man - who the women dubbed the \"man in beige\" - was in charge that evening. Though he wasn't present inside Room 103 - where the women were terrorised - \"all communication took place through him\", she says. One of the detainees had secretly filmed him in the station waiting room. But the shaky video wasn't much to go on. The BBC obtained an arrest report from 6 March, which was signed by the police station's acting head: Lieutenant Colonel AG Fedorinov. . We then found a local newspaper report from 2012 which mentions an Alexander Georgievich Fedorinov, with an accompanying photograph which seemed to match his image. . But because the photo was 10 years old, the BBC used facial recognition software to double-check - and found images matching the \"man in beige\" in the video were linked to a social media account in the name of Alexander Fedorinov. That same account was tagged in an online advert for job vacancies at Brateyevo police station. . The BBC put the allegations - that police officer Ivan Ryabov initiated and participated in the abuse of detainees, and that this abuse in some cases amounted to torture - to both Ryabov and Fedorinov, and to Russia's Investigative Committee. There was no response. . By uncovering the identity of their abuser, Marina, Anastasia and Alexandra hope that some form of justice and accountability will emerge. \"We want to make\u2026 it possible for the law to affect them,\" says Marina. \"No one can do this to another person, even if he is a government official.\"."},

He landed at Belfast City Airport - in the shadows of the famous Harland and Wolff shipyard cranes - at about 12:00 BST. King Charles and Camilla, the Queen Consort, were presented with gifts of truffles with an image of the Giant's Causeway on the tin and a bunch of flowers by Ella Smith and Lucas Watt, both aged 10, from Forge Integrated Primary School in the city. The King and Camilla travelled to Royal Hillsborough, given the prefix in 2021 due to the village's connection to the Royal Family, where people had been waiting since dawn to catch a glimpse of them. The King and Camilla spent time shaking hands and greeting those who had gathered in the main street of the village in County Down.

The King also met senior Stormont politicians, including Sinn F\u00e9in vice-president Michelle O'Neill, Democratic Unionist Party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and figures from the other main parties. He was introduced to troops at the castle, shortly after a 21-gun salute had taken place in the castle gardens. Outside there were smiles and one woman (below, left) held a photo of her meeting the then Prince of Wales when she received an MBE several years ago. The Hillsborough Fort Guard also stood outside during the King's visit to the royal residence. The King and the Queen Consort made their way to St Anne's Cathedral in Belfast for a service of reflection for the life of the Queen, their last formal engagement in Northern Ireland for the day. A large crowd gathered outside Belfast City Hall to witness the King and Camilla pass through the city centre. Large screens were placed in the city centre for those who wanted to watch the service. Inside the cathedral Prime Minister Liz Truss and Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Miche\u00e1l Martin were among those who took part in the service. It was Ms Truss's first visit to Northern Ireland since she became prime minister last week and she was greeted by Michelle O'Neill from Sinn F\u00e9in, whose part is the largest in the Stormont assembly. After the service the King and Queen Consort greeted those who had gathered in Writers' Square opposite the cathedral.

Quick progression was a big selling point, with the promise of branching out and owning his own direct sales company and earning six figures within a year. Watch . The Dark Side of Direct Sales.  on BBC iPlayer, or listen on . BBC Radio 4. . . \"That's more money than any graduate scheme at the time,\" says Matt, now 25. \"I was hooked. I was all in.\". A year-long BBC investigation, based on the experiences of dozens of ex-sales agents, suggests Matt's story, while an extreme example, was not unique. . It revealed concerns around exhausting working conditions, low pay and how some companies have been exploiting young people with little knowledge of the job market. After Lauren, now 20, lost her job bartending in London during the pandemic, an online message about a marketing vacancy seemed like a dream come true. During an interview, the director of the company asked what she would like to achieve in life. \"I said: 'Well, I'd love to retire my mum, I'd love to be able to drive a nice car.'\". Lauren says she was told that would be easy if she followed in her manager's footsteps. Like Matt, she was hooked by the dream of entrepreneurship. . She suggests the hustle culture - the idea of becoming your own boss and prioritising work above all else - and its prevalence on social media had a part to play, but says she was willing to \"grind\" to achieve her goals. Lauren's parents questioned the new role. \"But I was so defensive,\" she says. \"I told them that they weren't seeing 'the vision'.\" But the reality of the job quickly set in. Drawn in by descriptions of immediately earning \u00a3300-400 a week, Matt says he found out on his induction day that the role was commission-only. He was asked to register as self-employed, which meant no minimum wage, paid holiday, or sick pay. Determined to make a success of it, Matt says he tried his best to sell to customers on the street, working about 12 hours a day, six days a week. But over the 14 months he worked there, he made only \u00a37,900. Between having to pay for travel and accommodation during \"road trips\" - to sell in other towns or cities - he says he maxed out his overdraft and credit card. On one occasion, he started crying in front of a manager who told him off for his dishevelled appearance. \"I said, 'I can't afford shampoo, I can't afford hair gel.' So I'd had to use hand soap to try and make [my hair] look decent.\". For Lauren, it became clear at her second interview that she would be doing door-to-door sales. It was then that she was also told she would need to register as self-employed, earning commission only. \"If you put in the work, you won't even be on the doors for long,\" she says she was told, referring to the promise of moving up the chain. She describes the first day selling as \"horrific\", being instructed by her team leader to run door-to-door, waiting no longer than three seconds at each one. . \"I came into the office limping because my feet were swollen.\". She says the breaking point came after three weeks, when she wasn't able to take a toilet break during her period, and bled through her clothes. She describes \"begging\" a manager to find somewhere to change. . Lauren says he eventually agreed. \"He said: 'You're not giving 100%.' He asked: 'Do you even want this? Do you want to retire your mum? Your period can't stop you from doing that.' I just felt so humiliated.\". A spokeswoman for the company Lauren worked for said it does not tell sales agents that there are \"no toilet breaks or lunch breaks\". But describing the experience overall, Lauren says: \"I don't want to sound dramatic, but it was kind of like selling your soul.\". Something else links Matt and Lauren's experiences: a company called Credico, one of the biggest players in the direct sales industry in the UK. It is a company that essentially acts like a middleman. It contracts smaller sales companies, which get their recruits to go out and sell on behalf of big-name brands. Credico was originally set up in Canada and boasts up to 15,000 sales agents working for its partner companies worldwide. . It says it now has more than 100 sales companies in its UK network, most owned by people who started out as sales agents themselves. . Matt says Credico was described to young recruits as \"like Uber\". \"We were the taxi drivers, and the passengers were the clients. So Credico connect us and the clients together, they would give us the training materials and they will act as a go-between.\". Despite the fact they were self-employed, many of the sales agents at these smaller companies told the BBC they felt a \"lack of control\" about when and where they would go and sell. \"None of it was on my terms,\" Lauren says. And court documents from a case brought by Credico for competition reasons last year suggest it does direct some of what the independent offices do. For example, it provides the wording of the agreements that sales agents must sign when they are joining up to sell in its \"network\". Several experts called this structure into question. . They criticised the working conditions described, as well as the fact that some job adverts for these companies outline a base salary, calling it \"deeply misleading\". Employment lawyer Luke Menzies said there was a risk sales agents were being \"taken for a ride without realising it\". \"It seems to me, from what I've seen, that [sales agents] would have the right to go to an employment tribunal and say, 'I want my national living wage, I want my holidays.' And they would have the right to bring that claim.\". But he said ultimately the responsibility for these sales agents would lie with the smaller companies in the network. Labour MP Darren Jones, who chairs the House of Commons Business Committee, said he believed workers were being exploited. \"They are being exploited because they think they're signing up for an exciting job with a good salary that gives them prospects and actually, they arrive at the office and they're told they're self-employed, commission-only, door-to-door salespeople.\". He also questioned why reforms aimed at helping vulnerable workers, promised as part of the 2019 Queen's Speech, have not yet materialised. A government spokesman said new employment status guidance had been introduced, acting as a one-stop-shop for businesses and people to understand which employment rights apply to them. \"Exploitative practices have no place in our society, and we will investigate cases of malpractice,\" the spokesman added. A Credico spokesman said: \"Individuals are all engaged as independent contractors directly by independent sales offices, using a contract that is written using plain language to make it very clear that the individual will be self-employed.\". It said standard pay and contracting models, which are common in the industry, were used. \"The contractors enjoy the flexibility that self-employment brings, as they are free to work the hours and days they choose, with many working less hours than a standard five-day week.\". Credico also pointed out that it operates a whistleblowing programme for workers to flag concerns. Its spokesman added that the well-being of contractors was \"extremely important to them\". As for Credico's clients, it is still an approved supplier for Shell Energy, but a spokesman said it has not used its services since October 2021. . The National Deaf Children's Society said it was not aware of the allegations and had launched an investigation. A spokesman added any malpractice will be treated \"extremely seriously\". \"It is crucial that any fundraising carried out for us is respectful to both the public and anyone working on our behalf,\" he said, adding that the charity has \"sector-leading\" safeguards. . TalkTalk told the BBC it \"no longer\" has a relationship with Credico, but described the practices uncovered as \"shocking\". Matt now works in sales in a salaried job. Meanwhile, Lauren describes the skills she gained in direct sales as helpful in finding a marketing job where she's happy. But she added: \"I want young people to be aware. Please don't get caught up in the hustle and the go-getter lifestyle. You will get there 100%. Don't feel like you have to rush it.\".

{"a": "On Friday 2 April 1982, Argentina invaded the British overseas territory of the Falkland Islands. . It had claimed sovereignty over the islands for many years. The country's ruling military junta did not believe that Britain would attempt to regain the islands by force. The ruling military junta was wrong. . Britain, under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, assembled warships, refitted merchant ships and sent a task force 8,000 miles (12,900 km) across the globe to the South Atlantic. Over the next 10 weeks, 649 Argentine military personnel, 255 British military personnel, and three Falkland Islanders were killed. Forty years on, Tamsin McLeod, an islander who grew up in the shadow of the conflict and now lives in London, tells the BBC what her homeland means to her - and how the island families coped with their peaceful lives being thrust into the arena of war. \"Our nickname is 'Kelper' because of all the seaweed and kelp surrounding the islands, so I'm a Kelper or Falklander first and British second, and on the islands we are so, so eternally grateful for what the British did. I probably wouldn't be here today if that task force had not been sent. . \"My parents didn't really talk about it to me much as I grew up. \"It was something that happened, where you have the Liberation Day and the parades and the receptions, and you attend them and everything. And it's very personal. . \"But the older I've become the more my parents have opened up about it. My parents would say in passing, 'oh, yeah, your aunt and uncle were locked in the Goose Green town hall for 30 days'.\" . During the war more than 100 islanders were held at gunpoint and imprisoned in the community hall at Goose Green. They had been summoned to a meeting there by Argentine officials. They were kept at the hall, in appalling conditions, for nearly a month. In just two months of hostilities in the Falklands, 891 men died, 132 aircraft were lost, and 11 ships were sunk. \"It was always there. It's always in the background. It's the legacy of the conflict - especially with the landmines. It was completely normal to be surrounded by bits of land you couldn't go on, fenced off because there were landmines and if you step on one you could die. . \"So going on a walk, it was like, 'oh, yeah, here's wreckage from a helicopter or something from the war'. \"When the invasion happened, my mum was completing her O-levels. Imagine these being interrupted for three months, because you're being occupied and you're being told you have to learn everything in Spanish. . \"All of a sudden, you have to drive on the opposite side of the road, you've got a curfew. . \"My mum really, really vividly remembers Argentine soldiers turning up at her doorstep because my granddad was the local butcher at the time, and they were like, 'you need to kill mutton and feed us'. . \"And my granddad - he was born in England, he vaguely remembers the Second World War, and he did his national service before moving to the islands. And so he's like, 'I'm not putting my family at risk'. So he shipped his whole family out to Horseshoe Bay, which is another farming settlement in the middle of nowhere. . \"And that's my mum's main experience of the war - her dad being genuinely fearful.\" . Margaret Thatcher addressed the House of Commons on 3 April:. \"We are here because for the first time for many years British sovereign territory has been invaded by a foreign power. . \"After several days of rising tension in our relations with Argentina, that country's armed forces attacked the Falklands yesterday and established military control of the islands \u2026 By late afternoon yesterday it became clear that an Argentine invasion had taken place and that the lawful British government of the islands had been usurped. \"There is not a shred of justification and not a scrap of legality to the invasion. The Falkland Islands and their dependencies remain British territory - no aggression and no invasion can alter that simple fact. . \"It is the government's objective to see that the islands are freed from occupation and are returned to British administration at the earliest possible moment.\" . \"My dad is slightly older. He turned 18 in April during the conflict, he and his brother were helping feed and cook for the British soldiers. They gave their car, their motorbike, the jeep. People stayed on their floor. They were trying to do as much as they could. . \"My dad was a young man at that time and there were people his age dying, soldiers dying. \"You couldn't really escape it. But then in a positive way, you appreciate how lucky you are, how privileged you are. To call yourself a Falkland Islander, to be six generations to grow up here, to have a childhood surrounded by penguins and beaches, to have insanely good fresh air.\". \"The way I grew up, it was 'appreciate what you've got, because we could have really not had this'. \"When I came to the UK, people knew nothing about the Falklands, genuinely nothing. Especially people my age. . \"Occasionally some mention penguins - and sometimes you meet a friend's parents in their 40s or 50s and they remember the conflict. \"It's like, 'I remember hearing about it on the radio or seeing it on the television. Wasn't there a war in the 80s? Wasn't Margaret Thatcher involved?'. \"That's all they knew.\". \"I grew up there, it's my home. So it was completely normal. I didn't know anything different until I moved away and then went, 'oh, hang on a second, there's a whole wide world here'. \"There's still such a strong, strong feeling. My parents are still really close with lots of veterans. They're genuinely family friends. \"My godmother lost her son on the Sir Galahad. She came to the Falklands to see where he lost his life. And it's terrible, terrible circumstances. I don't think a mother should ever have to do that. And she stayed with my family and returned to the island several times since that original visit. . \"And because of that relationship, she became a really important part of my life.\". On 8 June, while preparing to unload soldiers from the Welsh Guards in Port Pleasant, RFA Sir Galahad was attacked by the Argentine Air Force, each carrying three Mk 82 500lb (227kg) bombs. . Sir Galahad was hit by two or three bombs, which exploded and started fires. The explosions and subsequent fire caused the deaths of 48 crew and soldiers. \"People should care about the war. People lost their lives. . \"We are very resilient. We fight for what we believe in and we really want to continue to fight to be British. \"The island has moved on from the war. We have made the most of the sacrifices lost. We still remember the past and we appreciate everything that's happened. But we're looking to the future now. \"We do not have a positive relationship with Argentina at all. It's not civil at all. . \"We are not just statistics and geography - we have heritage, we have history, we have lived experiences that are very valuable to us. . \"We're becoming the gateway to Antarctica on that entire side of the world, which is amazing. We're the scientific hub of the South Atlantic. We have more than 60 different nationalities, including a growing population from Zimbabwe due to the de-miners coming and removing the landmines, so we are really cosmopolitan. And we're really proud of that. . \"I probably will go back. It's home. It's where my family are. I love going home and visiting them and seeing friends. It's a lot slower. . \"That soil is my home. So I carry a piece of it with me wherever I go. My necklace has Falklands sand in it and I promise you, it does not come off. Ever. . \"The Falklands are a part of me and I'm a part of them.\".

{"a": "Some British farmers are calling for a ban on the UK production of toxic weedkiller Paraquat, saying studies suggest it could be a factor in the onset of Parkinson's Disease. It comes as hundreds of US farm workers pursue a legal case against its manufacturer, alleging it knew the risk and failed to warn them.  . Andy Pollard was once a farm manager who could leap into his tractor cab. But now his limbs are rigid and his body contorts with spasms. He has advanced Parkinson's Disease, and can no longer control his own movements. . He spent decades spraying herbicides on his land and, unaware of any danger, didn't use protective equipment. . \"Paraquat was a really good thing to use - or so we thought,\" his wife Sue says. \"Andy would be driving around the fields and the spray would be going everywhere.\". She had thought it was a coincidence that the only people she knew with Parkinson's were farm workers, then read about the potential connection with the chemical. \"Why hasn't it been regulated and stopped?\" she asks. \"We've got a lot of people in the same situation.\". Paraquat was first manufactured in the UK in the early 1960s and is sold globally - 377 companies have registered it for sale. It is one of the world's most popular and effective herbicides, millions of farmers have used it to kill weeds. But it is also one of the most dangerous and has caused thousands of poisoning deaths. . Its manufacturer Syngenta says claims of a link between Paraquat and Parkinson's are not supported by scientific evidence, stating it has undergone more than 1,200 safety studies. Andy regularly visits a Dorset farm run by charity Countrymen UK, founded by Julie Plumley after her father John was diagnosed with Parkinson's. The 30-acre working farm sells beef and lamb. In the yard, instead of tractors is a fleet of mobility scooters. \"The farmers come here not because they're ill,\" Julie explains, \"but because they want to get on with living.\". Parkinson's Disease is believed to be the world's fastest-growing neurological condition. It affects neurons in a specific area of the brain called the substantia nigra. . It is degenerative, gradually leading to tremors and stiffness in the limbs. Global studies show rural, agricultural areas often have higher rates of the disease. Julie explains her childhood farm was owned by the local council, so her father had to meet certain conditions. \"He had to use chemicals, because if you got too many dock leaves or thistles, they could take money away from you. Paraquat was the pesticide all the farmers used.\". He would carry a backpack filled with the chemical and spend hours hand-spraying the fields. \"He would have his sleeves rolled up, his arms bare, the liquid dripping down.\". John developed the disease in his 40s and always believed there was a connection to the chemicals. His suspicion deepened when his neighbour Ken Barnes was diagnosed around the same time - he was also in his 40s and had also been using Paraquat for years. . Ken now visits Julie's farm. He has a twinkle in his eye, but his clarity of speech has gone. \"It's a horrible disease,\" says his wife Sue. \"It's taken his life away.\". She says its manufacture in the UK and export should be stopped. \"I wouldn't want my son, who's got farming qualifications, ending up like his father.\". Paraquat has not been authorised for use in the EU since a court ruling in 2007. That is still the case in the UK after Brexit but it is still made - under the brand name Gramoxone - at Syngenta's plant in Huddersfield. It is exported to countries such as the US, Japan and Australia, with a fifth of exports going to the developing world. In the US, nearly 900 farmers and field workers have joined forces to sue the manufacturer, claiming not only is there a link between Paraquat and Parkinson's, but that Syngenta has deliberately hidden the health risks from the authorities. . Syngenta rejects the claims made in the remaining multidistrict litigation case, which is due to come to court later this year. The company's most recent financial statement shows that the company has already paid $187.5m into a settlement fund. But it said the company believes that all of these claims are without merit and the payment is simply to keep the claims from going any further. Toxicologist Prof Jon Heylings worked for Syngenta and its predecessor companies for more than 20 years. After retiring, he turned whistleblower, and has given evidence as an expert witness in the US legal action. . He said farmers who used it without protective equipment, damaging their skin, should be worried. \"If they went out the next day and actually used it again, and the next day, you could absorb more Paraquat through the skin, into the blood and then into the brain,\" he says. \"The issue is really does it actually cause Parkinson's when it gets into the brain? That's one of the key issues around the whole exposure. And if this chemical does cause Parkinson's, who is responsible?\" . There is no scientific consensus and many conflicting studies on any possible association between Paraquat and Parkinson's. In the UK, research charity Cure Parkinson's said exposure was \"a well-recognised environmental risk factor\" but Parkinson's UK said studies show \"a small increased risk\" at most. In the US, a 17-year-long study found Paraquat contributed to Parkinson's onset and progression. And research by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences - part of the US Department of Health - found people who used Paraquat developed Parkinson's two-and-a-half times more often than non-users. But the US regulator, the Environmental Protection Agency, says an updated study couldn't replicate those results and no clear link was found. But there are scientists who believe Syngenta is putting profit before product safety and public health. Prof Heylings has a Syngenta regulatory strategy document from 2003 written while Paraquat was still being used by UK farmers. Its author acknowledges a growing number of studies \"citing a correlation between incidence of Parkinson's Disease and herbicide use, including Paraquat\". He explains: \"Syngenta are trying to influence researchers who are working on Paraquat and also influence the direction of the research because the last thing Syngenta wants is a big blow up on Parkinson's. So the strategy was to downplay anything to do with the potential neurotoxicity of Paraquat that could lead to Parkinson's.\" . It said: \"In our view, Jon Heylings is technically not qualified to comment on Paraquat and Parkinson's Disease. He is certainly not aware of Syngenta's research on the issue, which was mostly conducted from 2008 onwards, after he left the company. We spent tens of millions of dollars investigating Paraquat and Parkinson's disease - and this figure doesn't include the monetary value of internal expert time.\". In a statement, Syngenta said it had invested hundreds of millions of dollars over the product lifetime to ensure its safety. \"Paraquat has been the subject of more than 1,200 safety studies submitted to, and reviewed by, regulatory authorities around the world. Recent thorough reviews performed by the most advanced and science-based regulatory authorities including the United States and Australia continue to support the view that Paraquat is safe.\".

{"a": "The first generation who came to post-war Britain from the Indian subcontinent arrived with as little as \u00a33 in their pockets - all the money they could bring in under strict currency controls. Their descendants, in their millions, are part of the make-up of contemporary Britain, but many of their stories are still to be told - and they reveal so much about the process of migration. . Mohammed Ajeeb arrived in Britain in 1957 from Pakistan with a battered suitcase. His first home was in Nottingham with 28 other men from Mirpur, in Pakistani-administered Kashmir. He'd had a clerical job in Pakistan but could only find work in a factory. . \"I cried at night in my bed,\" he confesses. \"I wanted to go back but I didn't want to be seen as a failure. I thought, 'I'm a determined young man, I want to succeed by hook or crook in this country,' and that carried me.\" . Over the years, he fought many battles for equal pay and against racism - but he stayed and went on to become the mayor of Bradford. . The 1948 British Nationality Act meant people who came from the former colonies or the empire automatically became British citizens. Britain needed workers to rebuild the country after World War Two. . Many who came in the early years from the Indian subcontinent were single, young men. They mostly worked the difficult shifts in the factories, foundries, and textile mills in places like Birmingham, Bradford, and West London. These men thought they were coming for only a few years: they never imagined generations of their family would one day live here. . Gnawing loneliness, and missing family, was part of life for these pioneers, the so-called \u00a33 generation. Many wrote to their family on blue aerogram letters. . Gunwant Grewal came over from Ludhiana, Punjab in 1965. Life wasn't what she had imagined. She had been a teacher in India, but could only find factory work when she arrived. . She lived in a room in Southall, west London, with her husband and daughter in a shared house, a far cry from her spacious home in India. She desperately missed her father who she wrote to regularly.  . \"My tears were on my letter as I was writing. My father said, 'Why was your letter damp?' and I said, 'Oh I was having a cup of tea,' when really it was tears. But slowly, slowly it got better.\" . One time walking past a bus stop, she saw an elderly Sikh man who reminded her of her father. She spontaneously hugged him. . A phone call to hear a loved one's voice was out of the question. Ravi Patel arrived in 1967 with \u00a31, having spent the rest on the journey over to Britain. He recalls that phoning India cost \u00a31.40 per minute, a vast sum then. So Ravi called his family in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, twice a year: once on Diwali and once on his father's birthday. . It remained that way until the early 2000s, when communications were revolutionised by companies like Lebara, which was started by three British-Sri Lankan entrepreneurs and offered cheap telephone calling cards. . You could now phone the Indian subcontinent for as cheaply as one penny a minute. Decades after Ravi left India, he could now speak to his best friend whenever he wanted. When I started interviewing these pioneers nearly a decade ago, their experiences were not widely documented, but in recent years there has been a growing interest in the stories of people who came from the former empire and made their once colonial ruler home. And the struggles of that generation for equality and against racism are now better known. Each generation has a different attachment to the place left and the place where they now live - but these private, and sometimes delicate, tussles between parents and children are rarely recorded. . I have been reporting on the ups and downs of . the relationship between Farah Sayeed and her mother Runi. , who came in 1968 as a young bride from Dhaka, East Pakistan, now Bangladesh. Farah was born a year later. Runi's generation often bore and raised their children alone, without the support of their own mothers or any wider family. For the next generation, it was different. . In late 2001, Farah was in Liverpool when she called her mother in London to tell her she was about to give birth. Runi says, \"I started to shiver and scream because I'm her mother and I should be near.\" She jumped into the car and drove to Liverpool. She arrived to be told her grandchild had been born. \"That was the happiest moment of my life,\" Runi smiles, \"I am eternal now.\". Waiting in the hospital corridor to see them jogged a memory. She remembered giving birth to Farah and writing a letter to her mother in then East Pakistan, saying she now realised what being a mum meant. . Runi recalled lying in the hospital bed with her newborn, in pain, and how she missed her mother who was so far away. She was hungry and wanted to be comforted by her mother's food. So when, decades later, she walked into Farah's room and met her grandson, she remembered that hunger and ache for her own mother. . She asked Farah what she wanted to eat. Chicken biryani, she replied. Runi searched Liverpool's halal shops and made that dish for her daughter. Three Pounds in My Pocket Series 5 starts on Friday 8 April at 11:00 BST on . BBC Radio 4. . You can hear the previous series . on BBC Sounds . Farah, after giving birth to her son, had her own revelation. \"Within seconds of becoming a mum, I had a completely different appreciation of what my mum must have gone through. She didn't have any real extended family around, compared to how supported I felt.\". Five years later, in 2006, Farah had another child and decided to return to London, to be near her mother. She had left the family home in 1988 wanting to get away from the burden of her parents' expectations, with a yearning to live her own life, her way. . In deciding to come back to be near her parents, she wanted to give her children something she never had - grandparents. Hers had lived in Bangladesh and she barely saw them. . Hearing Farah, I realised that there must be many thousands from the second generation, born in Britain, who grew up orphaned from their grandparents. This relationship between our children and their grandparents - the pioneers - has such a precious meaning for us, as it was something we never had. For Farah, life had come full circle. She wanted her children to be immersed in Bengali food, culture and language - things that were so much a part of her parents' home. It was the same home Farah had wanted to escape in the late 1980s. \"When you're young, you want to fit in, and when you're older, you're just confident - fitting in matters less than the things that made you who you are.\". Testimonies like these are an important part of the story of migration and the story of Britain. What began as an empire ended up with former subjects of the Raj settling as citizens, with generations now living here. Each individual making a choice about what to discard from the place left behind and what to hold on to in Britain. Runi's husband died last year. Her voice breaks as she tells me, \"It feels like you build a house and you start with one brick. I built the whole big house over the years with him. We fought, we argued. But we wanted to build that house, and we did.\". He is buried near their home in London. As a young man, he wanted to rest in Bangladesh's earth, in the family plot there. . But later, he realised his home was where his children and grandchildren were. His centre of gravity had shifted. . There had been many difficult and lonely times, but now three generations were successfully established in Britain. Runi tells me she has reserved a plot next to his. \"I feel that this is a big tree, solidly rooted into a land, and it cannot be pulled out.\"."},

{"a": "The father of a girl who was raped aged 13 and has been waiting two years for her case to be heard, has spoken about the devastating impact of court delays. The girl now faces a further delay of nine months after a suitable judge could not be found to hear the case. It is one of many criminal trials which are stuck in the court system, with funding cuts and Covid blamed for the backlog. The government says swift action for victims is a priority. Serious sexual offences are taking the longest time.  on record to go through the Crown Courts in England and Wales. The father, interviewed by the BBC, described how the delays to his daughter's rape trial had affected her and the rest of the family. Earlier this summer, as they prepared for the case to finally be heard, they were told they would have to wait another nine months. In a moving interview with the Today programme's Mishal Husain, the father described the trauma of the initial attack and the subsequent court delays.  . It was the summer of 2020 - when Covid lockdown had been lifted enough to allow visits to parks. One afternoon, the man's daughter - who was 13 at the time - took a bus to meet some friends in a neighbouring village. When she began her journey home she was attacked in broad daylight. \"Obviously we're careful about where she goes. She wasn't out at night,\" explains her father. . The girl was interviewed by police. A man was caught, arrested and charged with the attack. Later - when the family knew the case was going to trial - the girl was cross-examined. Vulnerable victims and child witnesses can have their evidence video-recorded in advance, away from courtrooms. It is then played during the trial and means, in most cases, the vulnerable person does not need to attend in person. \"This was all highly distressing but my daughter got through it\u2026 Then the nightmare started to kick in,\" her father says. . The family were initially looking at a two-year wait for the trial to start, in Crown Court, in June 2022. It would have been straight after the Jubilee Bank Holiday. But on the last working day before the holiday, they received news proceedings had been adjourned for another nine months - until March 2023. . The father says they received \"a garbled\" phone message from a support team member at the court at lunchtime - followed by an email from the jury team leader at 16:00. The email explained that the case could not go ahead because the Judicial Secretariat, which sources judges for the court, had been \"unsuccessful in securing a judge\". It went on to say: \"It also appears that the CPS, the Crown Prosecution Service, are not ready for the hearing to go ahead and the matter has had to be put back.\" The CPS says it was ready for the trial to go ahead on 6 June, the day it was originally listed for. . The news \"blew us apart\" says the father. \"My daughter had spoken to the judge at pre-trial - she'd met the barristers, all the court officials.\". The family had been promised the trial would be heard by the same judge they had met in earlier proceedings. They accept it has been \"a very difficult time\" for courts since the pandemic struck in 2020, but feel this does not excuse what they have been through. \"It's just been a complete nightmare. There's a whole litany of stuff we just cannot believe,\" says the father. One of the lowest points was when, just before Christmas, the family realised the alleged attacker had a job in a shop near their house. . \"The guy who was charged with the rape was working 30ft away from my daughter's bedroom. We couldn't believe that.\" . The family called the police, who said there was nothing they could do. Then they turned to the CPS who also said nothing could be done because, while the bail conditions stipulated non-contact, there was nothing in the accused's bail terms about having to remain a certain distance from the family. The CPS took a statement from the victim with a view to preparing an application to amend the bail conditions. But the father says he felt the CPS, courts and the police just \"didn't seem interested\" and he ended up approaching the retail chain which had employed the man. Soon after, the accused stopped working at the shop. . The father is also critical of the local social services team - which he says only met his daughter once - and he \"never saw hide nor hair of them again\". He describes the support provided by all the official bodies involved in the case as a \"continuum of disappointment\" - with \"little or no interest after the man was charged\". His daughter is now 15. She will be 16 before the new trial date - three years older than when the alleged attack took place. So how is she dealing with it? . Her father has been \"amazed how strong she has been... She wanted to go to court\", he says. . But the process has left the family floored. And the rape ordeal, and subsequent delays, have severely affected his daughter's life. She used to be \"a very happy-go-lucky sort of person\" before the attack. Now she suffers from mood swings and spends a lot of time in her room crying, he says. \"My daughter doesn't want cuddles, not even from her mother,\" he says. The teenager stopped going to school, and for the past two years she has been home-schooled. . He would like to be able to move on because every time something about the case comes up, it distresses his daughter all over again. \"She doesn't want to go out, we can't take her anywhere.\". The family have even thought of moving away. . \"We want to get some kind of resolution that it's over, we can move on. We're all flattened, just totally devastated by the whole thing.\" . In his BBC interview, he admits he has regrets about taking the case to court. His family were unprepared for the \"grief and frustration\" they experienced when dealing with the judiciary. . \"It seems like total incompetence.\". He says trying to get through to the CPS, and sometimes the police, was frustrating. They would be told: \"Oh, that officer doesn't work here any more, he's on leave, he's training.\". Their local MP did help - and forwarded a letter from the region's chief prosecutor for the CPS, in which it said they were \"concerned\" and had asked for the matter to be investigated further. But the letter also said that the listing of court hearings was a \"judicial function\" - and any complaint in relation to the delay should be addressed to the court, not the CPS. It's a case of \"passing the buck\", says the father. The family wrote to the Secretary of State for Justice, Dominic Raab, on the day they heard the trial had been postponed. They had no response until the Today programme got in touch. The letter they received apologised for the delayed response and expressed sympathy. It continued: \"The decision about whether a trial can go ahead and when, is a matter for the judiciary. This includes any adjournments. It's not possible for government ministers or officials to intervene in this process. . \"This isn't through a lack of sympathy for the situation that your family is in, but because judges are completely independent, and it is important that nothing is done to undermine this position.\". Responding to our request for comment, a Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \"Restoring the swift access to justice victims deserve is our absolute priority and we are spending almost half a billion pounds to reduce wait times, as well as boosting funding for victim support to \u00a3460m over the next three years. \"Our actions had already brought the pandemic-induced backlog down by around 2,000 cases but the barristers' strike action is undermining those efforts and will only see more victims face further delays.\".

{"a": "When the luxury liner Oceanos started taking on water in rough seas during a voyage around the coast of South Africa in 1991, musician Moss Hills and his colleagues suddenly found themselves responsible for everyone on board.  . It was during dinner that Moss Hills began to realise just how severe the storm was. The ship's waiters, normally completely adept at carrying drinks and food without spilling anything, were struggling. Moss, a guitarist from Zimbabwe working on board the cruise liner alongside his wife Tracy, a bass player, had never seen the waiters dropping trays before.   . Earlier that day, gale-force winds and heavy rains had delayed sailing for the final leg of the cruise towards Durban several times. But with no sign of conditions improving, the captain eventually decided to lift anchor and the Oceanos, with 581 guests and crew on board, sailed off into 40-knot winds and 9m-high (30ft) waves. . Moss and Tracy, both in their 30s, would usually host parties up on the pool deck as the ship sailed away from port. But that day the party had been moved indoors, and Moss braced his body while he played his guitar, trying to keep his balance as the ship pitched and rolled. \"The storm just got worse and worse,\" Moss says. . At dinner, Tracy - who her husband describes as unflappable - decided to go to their cabin to organise an emergency bag, just in case. \"Off she went,\" Moss says, \"and suddenly - boom - all the lights went out.\" . When none of the ship's officers appeared to issue instructions, Moss, who was not easily frightened, began to feel uneasy. \"You're on a ship in the middle of the ocean, in the dark of night, in a terrible storm,\" he says, \"I felt this tightening in my stomach.\". When small, dim emergency lights came on, Moss went up to the lounge to check on the musical instruments on stage. Microphone and cymbal stands were strewn about. Then he suddenly realised he couldn't hear the constant, throbbing, background noise of the engines. The ship had lost power and was slowing down. . Soon the 153m (502ft) Oceanos was drifting sideways onto the crashing waves. The ship, says Moss, was getting hammered. Anxious guests began pouring into the lounge. Pot plants, ashtrays, and chairs were sliding around, and people had to move from their seats to sit on the floor as the ship lurched wildly from one side to the other, port to starboard. About an hour passed, and the mood in the lounge grew tense. Moss grabbed an acoustic guitar and began singing with some of the other entertainers to try to keep people calm. But as time stretched on, Moss noticed that the ship was heeling - no longer coming back to a level position when it was being thrown about in the storm. . \"Something bad is happening,\" Moss said to Tracy, \"I'm going to try and find out what's going on.\". Hear Moss tell his story in a new series of . Life Changing.  on 6 April 2022 at 0900 on BBC Radio 4 - or listen to the . podcast. . . More from Life Changing:. Hanging on to the handrails, Moss and another entertainer, Julian, a magician from Yorkshire, made their way through the darkness below deck. They could hear excited voices speaking many different languages. Officers were running around, some were carrying bags, some had life jackets on, and some were wet. . \"Everyone was pretty wild-eyed and panicked-looking,\" Moss says. \"We were trying to ask, 'What's happening?' but it was like we didn't exist.\". Julian and Moss continued down to the engine room - the lowest part of the ship. \"We were way below the waterline, in the dark, on our own, and there was no-one there,\" Moss says. \"That would never, ever happen, even when you're docked.\". The thick, metal doors which acted as a safety barrier by preventing water moving from one compartment of a ship to another in the event of flooding, were tightly closed. \"But it sounded like there was a large body of water sloshing about behind those watertight doors,\" Moss says. The Oceanos was sinking. . Back up in the lounge, there had still not been any announcements about what was going on. Moss found the cruise director who said the captain had told her they were going to have to abandon the ship. . \"Then we found out that one lifeboat had already gone with a lot of the crew and senior officers on it,\" he says. Moss and the others had no idea how to evacuate a cruise ship, nor how to launch the lifeboats which hung high above the deck along each of the ship's sides, but there was nobody more qualified around to do it. One by one, they began lowering the starboard side lifeboats down to the deck. They didn't know how to keep them steady as people got on, so Moss improvised by standing with one leg on the deck of the ship and the other on a lifeboat. . But each time the ship rolled to starboard, Moss would have to jump back onto the Oceanos before the lifeboat swung away, opening up a gap of a couple of metres, and then swung back, smashing with such force against the ship's hull that bits of it came splintering off. Each heaving lifeboat, now with as many as 90 people in it, many screaming in fear, would then be lowered down to the sea on cables. But Moss had no idea how to start the engines or even where the keys were. \"We'd let them go, off into the night, and they would just drift away into the pounding waves,\" he says. \"The people in the lifeboats had a torturous time - they were getting deluged in spray, it was cold and completely dark, but we just had to carry on until all of the starboard side lifeboats were launched.\". By now the Oceanos was taking in more and more water and heeling markedly to its starboard side. Launching the remaining lifeboats on the port side safely was near impossible. Instead of being lowered down to the water once loaded up with people, the lifeboats would cling to the side of the ship until the next big wave rolled in, tipping the ship enough to let them dangle freely. \"And then gravity would suddenly drop the lifeboat three or four metres (13 ft) in one go, almost tipping people out into the open water, it was horrific,\" Moss says. Eventually, he realised it was too dangerous to continue.  . \"In the effort to try and rescue people we were possibly going to kill them,\" Moss says. And time was running out. Unable to launch any more lifeboats, but with hundreds of people still in need of rescue, Moss and others made their way up to the ship's bridge - where they assumed they would find the captain and the remaining senior officers - to ask what to do next. \"We looked inside, but there was no one there,\" Moss says. \"That's when we realised - it's just us.\". Orangey-red lights blinked in the darkness, but Moss had no idea what most of the equipment was for, never mind how it worked. They took turns trying to use the radio to send an SOS.  . \"I was calling, 'Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!' and just waiting for somebody to answer,\" Moss says. A big, deep, rich voice eventually replied. \"Yes, what is your Mayday?\". Relieved, Moss explained that he was on the cruise ship Oceanos and that it was sinking. \"OK. How long have you got left to float?\". \"I don't know - we've got the starboard railings in the water, we're rolling around, we've taken on a huge amount of water,\" Moss said. \"We still have at least 200 people on board.\". \"OK. What is your position?\". \"We're probably about halfway between the port of East London and Durban.\". \"No, no, no, what are your coordinates?\". Moss had no idea what their coordinates were. \"What rank are you?\". \"Well, I'm not a rank - I'm a guitarist.\". A moment's silence. \"What are you doing on the bridge?\". \"Well, there's nobody else here.\". \"Who's on the bridge with you?\". \"So I said, 'It's me, my wife - the bass player, we've got a magician here\u2026'\". Moss was put in contact with two small ships that were close to the Oceanos. They told Moss to find the captain and get him onto the bridge. But Moss had no idea where he was. \"I knew he wouldn't be down below because we were sinking,\" he says. \"I was making regular checks to see where the water level was, and one deck below us was flooded.\". Eventually, Moss found the captain, right at the back of the ship, smoking in the darkness. Moss explained that they needed his help - urgently. \"He was just looking at me, wide-eyed and vacant, saying, 'It's not necessary, it's not necessary,'\" Moss says. \"I think he was in deep, deep shock.\". The two ships close to the Oceanos had only one lifeboat each, so there was little they could do to help. They shared the sinking vessel's coordinates with the South African authorities who began to organise an air rescue mission. . As the storm continued to batter the ship, Moss and Tracy sat together in the near darkness, praying that help would arrive before it was too late. . \"I think the ship is going to go down and it's very likely we're going to go down with it,\" Moss said to his wife. He and Tracy had a 15-year-old daughter, Amber, who'd been on board the Oceanos for the holidays and disembarked just days earlier. Amber was now back at boarding school in South Africa. \"She can't lose both parents,\" Moss remembers saying. \"Whatever we do, we've got to make sure at least one of us gets off.\". More than three hours passed before the first rescue helicopter arrived and hovered above the ship. . Two navy divers were winched down to the Oceanos' deck. They said they needed help to get everyone off before the ship sank, and Moss was given a five-minute crash course on how to run a helicopter airlift. \"Remember, the harness needs to be quite tight under people's underarms,\" the navy diver told him. \"Make sure you get it right because otherwise they'll tip upside down and fall out - you'll kill them on the deck. Do two at a time or else we're going to run out of time. OK? Go.\". One navy diver went to organise the helicopter rescue at the rear of the ship and Tracy and Moss were to organise a second at the front. But as the ship sank ever lower beneath the waves, people began jumping off the steeply pitching deck in panic and a rigid inflatable had to be launched into the churning sea to rescue them. . Dangling in mid-air from the helicopter cable, people who Moss was trying to save were being blown against parts of the ship by the strong winds as they were winched into the sky. There was no way of knowing how badly hurt they were and Moss momentarily lost his nerve. But with so many people still on board, he realised he had no choice but to keep going. In total, five helicopters joined the rescue mission, shuttling back and forth, carrying 12 people at a time to safety as dawn broke and the darkness lifted. . Drained and exhausted, Moss and Tracy were among the last to be strapped into harnesses. \"As we were hovering above the ship it really hit me,\" Moss says, \"I could see the Oceanos was in a critical situation. We could see waves breaking over the bow where we had been rescuing people.\". When the helicopter carrying Moss touched down on the grass, cruise passengers ran towards him singing and cheering, and reaching out to hug him. \"I started to choke up and sob,\" Moss says, \"and then I collapsed.\". On 4 August 1991, about 45 minutes after the last person on board had been airlifted to safety, the Oceanos slipped away below the water. Everyone who had been put into lifeboats was rescued by passing ships and remarkably no lives were lost. . Moss and Tracy, who now live in Liverpool, continued working as cruise ship entertainers for many years. Even now, three decades later, Tracy prefers not to talk about the sinking or dwell on how close they all came to losing their lives. . But Moss, who's been asked about the Oceanos many, many times, finds it cathartic to talk about. He looks back on what happened with great relief. \"I'm not invincible,\" Moss says, \"but if I can get through that, I can get through anything.\". There was an inquiry in Greece which found the captain of the Oceanos and four other senior officers negligent in the ship's sinking. All images courtesy of Moss Hills, unless otherwise stated.

{"a": "The government is being taken to court today by 276 deaf people over the lack of British Sign Language (BSL) interpretation at the televised coronavirus briefings. The hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice in London will see a judge decide if the complainants are entitled to compensation. Campaigner Lynn Stewart-Taylor says the lack of provision during the pandemic made the deaf community feel \"excluded\" and \"like we're an afterthought.\". The government says they \"established BSL interpretation at the No10 Covid press conferences via the BBC News channel.\". The case is being heard on Friday September 23 - which happens to be International Day of Sign Languages. A judicial review last year found that out of over 173 Covid briefings to the date of the review, two were unlawful because BSL was not provided on screen. . But Ms Stewart-Taylor, who founded the campaign group #WhereIsTheInterpreter at the start of the pandemic, told the.  BBC's Access All podcast.  that the first nine Covid briefings in March 2020 had no BSL interpreter present. Speaking through a BSL interpreter, she said that the deaf community did not initially know how serious the pandemic was - because they just weren't being told, which was \"terrifying\". The remaining ministerial briefings had an on-screen interpreter superimposed on the screen which was available on the BBC News Channel, iPlayer and later on Government social media channels. . But Ms Stewart-Lynn argues that this meant deaf people could only find out what was happening if they used the BBC. . Ms Stewart-Taylor says it should not be up to individual broadcasters like the BBC to provide the service, but for the government to provide a BSL interpreter and in the room next to speakers so that the original live televised stream and all follow up news reports and clips will always have a signer present. . Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland had in-person interpreters at their devolved briefings from the outset, and so circumnavigated the issue. In the latest episode of Access All. , presenter Nikki Fox discusses the on-going BSL court case with campaigners Lynn and Liam. There is a full transcript available. We also hear from actor Leo Long, the star of the new Netflix film, I Used To Be Famous, on being neurodiverse and playing the role of an autistic drummer. Liam O'Dell, a deaf and disabled freelance journalist who has been following the case says: \"There's a real sense from the government that they're just not taking this seriously. . \"Conferences are still happening where interpretation is not being provided there in person. But if it's in person you don't have to worry about it being just on a BBC channel, because it's accessible by default.  . \"A recent example is Liz Truss stood on the steps of Downing Street, making her first speech as Prime Minister and there was no BSL interpreter next to her. . \"So there's a sense the Government still doesn't get it. It's not about the compensation, it's merely a more punitive measure to hit the Government a little bit financially and to say: 'Look, this is what will happen if you keep treating deaf people as second-class citizens.'\". Many deaf people who use BSL as their first language say they cannot rely on subtitles because for them, English is their second language and the average reading age for deaf people is often reported as being around nine years old.  . The issue has been rolling through the courts for some time. In a case from July 2021, a deaf woman won a claim against the government after a judge found a lack of sign language at two televised Covid briefings had \"served to disempower, to frustrate and to marginalise\". Katie Rowley, then 36, from Leeds, started court action after the events went ahead without interpreters on screen. The government denied breaching its legal obligation to make broadcasts accessible to deaf people. But in his ruling, a judge said the lack of provision constituted discrimination. Ms Rowley is one of the 276 deaf people bringing action against the government in this most recent court case. She uses BSL as her first language and is also dyslexic - making English language subtitles doubly difficult to read. \"I am a slow reader - so that means when I was reading the subtitles, I would miss so much information and [it] would just mess up my head. It would be so difficult - it became impossible,\" Ms Rowley previously told the BBC through an interpreter. A government spokesman says: \"We are committed to supporting disabled people and established BSL interpretation at the No10 Covid press conferences via the BBC News channel and iPlayer, available on all TV packages as part of Freeview.\". If the government is successful in today's hearing, the case will be struck out, although claimants will be able to appeal. If the campaigners are successful, the case could end up going to full trial. If the judge rules in their favour, it will then be decided later how much compensation to award. \"We're in 2022, and we expect to be part of that wider community,\" says Ms Stewart-Taylor. \"To be accepted for the language we use, the culture we have, and so [this case] is about recognising us as a part of the wider community.\".

{"a": "Children as young as 11 have been subjected to brutal attacks by teenagers in a Lancashire town - with the assaults filmed and shared on social media. . Victims' mothers say police aren't doing enough to stop the group and have taken matters into their own hands. . The mother of one girl said she was told her daughter could have been one blow away from losing her life. Lancashire Police say they take assault and anti-social behaviour seriously. . The BBC spoke to eight sets of parents in Chorley whose children were violently assaulted. . The parents believe the police have not responded fast enough, and say that's why they feel compelled to share their footage further - and have asked us to show it. They also want to illustrate the seriousness of the attacks. It's thought the same group of teenagers was responsible for all the incidents. The videos show children being dragged to the ground - squealing and crying out as they try to shield their heads from kicks and punches. Voices of others can be heard, off-camera, egging-on the attackers. Filming such violence and humiliation, and then sharing it online, has become known by the term \"patterning\" - with the aim of embarrassing victims even further by forwarding the videos across the web. A BBC News investigation has spent months talking to people in England and Wales about their experiences of reporting crime - victims who say they have been left in despair, forced to do their own detective work, and waited too long for police help. . Lisa's daughter - 14-year-old Bethany - was set upon by a group of girls and was viciously beaten. She managed to call her mother during the attack in April last year. \"I got a phone call - with her absolutely screaming 'Mum, please. They've got me. They've got my hair. My hair is falling out. Now they've stomped all over me.'. \"I could hear what the girls were saying. 'Kick her again. Kick her again. She's down, kick her again.'\" . The violence was also being filmed and would soon be posted on social media. . \"They punched her numerous times and stamped on her head. They all took turns. They pretended to let her up, but then hit her back to the ground and did it again,\" says Lisa. \"The doctor actually said that one more stamp to the head would have most likely taken her life.\". Lisa says the police were called as the assault was happening. \"We rang 999 while she was on the phone. We begged them. Nobody appeared. The [police] never arrived for 48 hours.\". Lisa says despite calling 999, there was \"no urgency whatsoever\" despite officers being aware of the group having caused trouble across the town. It took weeks, she says, for Bethany's attackers to be arrested. Two of the girls involved have now written a letter of apology after being given a conditional caution. Although Lisa believes it's not a case of officers failing to care. \"I got the impression the police believed it was pointless - that nothing will come of it.\". Lancashire Police told us: \"When people call us in an emergency, we will always be there to answer the phone and to send officers as soon as we can where there is an ongoing threat or risk.\". Another mum, Leanna, recalls the moment her 11-year-old daughter, Indie, came home after being attacked in a park. . \"She walked through the door, her face was swollen. She had a burst lip and her hair was falling out. I've never in my life seen her that scared and upset,\". Leanna says they headed straight to the Chorley Police Station to report what had happened. At the front desk, she says she asked to see an officer - but was told there was no-one available to see her. . \"I was gobsmacked, in disbelief really,\" she says - explaining how it took officers four days to take a statement. Two of those in the attack would later receive a voluntary caution. \"The police are the ones supposed to be protecting the children. They're supposed to be there to take the worries away and say, 'Don't worry, they're not going to do it again.'\". In a statement, Lancashire Police said: \"When there is no ongoing risk or threat, or crime in action, we will arrange to visit people at a time convenient to them so we can investigate and solve crime and deliver the best outcomes for all.\". But Leanna believes the police's response to these types of crimes needs to change. . \"These girls feel vulnerable. They're scared. It's all over social media.\". Another 11-year-old, Ellissia, was attacked on the same day as Leanna's daughter, in a subway at the same park, by the same group. \"They're just brutal. It's horrific watching [the video],\" says Ellissia's mum Jade. \"I feel like she's just a baby. And that's your baby on that floor. I'm just so angry with them.\". After ringing the police, Jade says it took two weeks for an officer to visit the family. She says she was told police would only arrest the attackers if her daughter's injuries were more severe - like brain damage. . Two of those involved in the attack received a voluntary caution, which Jade says is completely unacceptable considering the violence used. \"You expect the police to do everything to make sure that you get justice for your child - and when they don't, you feel like you've been let down and there's nothing you can do about it.\". Jade says the group of teenagers has been allowed to run riot for too long. . \"They're not only attacking 11-year-old kids, they're attacking members of the public, bars, pubs, people's businesses.\" . \"If [the police] had reigned it in then, none of this would have happened.\". Lancashire Police say they are proud of their \"proactive approach to policing\" in Chorley and elsewhere. \"We regularly run operations aimed at tackling anti-social behaviour as part of our aim to deliver an outstanding service to the public and build confidence.\". If you've been affected by the issues raised in this report, details of organisations offering information and support for bullying are available via . BBC Action Line. . Each mum we spoke to described not just the physical, but also the mental scars left on their children after the attacks. . Jade believes Ellissia has lost confidence, but tries to \"put on a little show to stay above water for everybody else\". Leanna says Indie is resilient but fearful. . Lisa says Bethany didn't leave the house for a year and has now been diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). She should be going out locally and making memories - says Lisa - but instead she travels to other towns with her friends to avoid her attackers.  . In a statement, Lancashire Police said: \"We recognise the impact that these incidents have had on the victims and their families, and we have done a huge amount to both support them and to keep them updated.\". Outside Chorley Police Station last month, parents gathered to show their frustration and anger - each mum holding a large photo of their child. \"If there is any police looking out the window, this is my daughter's face after she was stamped on so many times,\" shouts Lisa in front of the gathered crowd - her photo showing Bethany's red, swollen face. \"If I had done that to my child,\" she says, \"I, rightfully, would have been taken right away.\" . Another mum - Toni - is there. Her son suffered one of the worst attacks. He was beaten to the ground by a group of boys. . \"[The gang] punched him, kicked him, headbutted him. He could have come home a lot worse. He could have not come home [at all].\" . Toni says she has repeatedly asked police for updates but, four months on, is still waiting for an outcome. . Lancashire Police say they are still investigating the assault on Toni's son. . The force says all calls in relation to all the incidents in this article have been \"dealt with appropriately\". \"We have identified and arrested offenders and they have been dealt with in line with national guidance on dealing with juveniles.\". Some parents, says Toni, are keen to enact their own form of justice against the teenagers. . \"I'm glad they haven't done. But something has got to give before a family is going to end up ruined. . \"Is somebody going to end up dead? Whether it be one of our children or one of their children. . \"Then are they going to wake up and do something about it? It's too little too late by then as far as I'm concerned.\". Meanwhile dozens of parents are being proactive - patrolling the park where the children were attacked. . \"I can't believe it's come to this, but I understand why it has, because our children aren't being protected,\" says Lisa. \"I've got to make sure that if my daughter's down here that I've got to do the police's job. I've got to make sure she's OK.\". The mothers claim police foot patrols are non-existent - and say when they've called 999 nothing has happened. \"What good has it done us?\" says Leanna. . \"Look what we're having to resort to. We entrust the police to be there to protect our children. And because they can't do that, we're going to have to do it.\". Follow . Ed Thomas on Twitter.

{"a": "A disabled member of the House of Lords says she \"fears\" disabled people could end up living in care homes if a \"severe\" shortage in personal assistants is not addressed. Baroness Jane Campbell, a cross-party peer, and others have been struggling to recruit PAs in recent years.   . Personal assistants, known as PAs, help with care and general tasks to enable individuals to live independently. The government said \u00a3500m will be used to \"develop the existing workforce\". Veteran disability campaigner Baroness Campbell contacted the BBC's . Access All podcast.  to say: \"The situation is so bad I fear disabled people will be forced back into living in instructional settings. . \"Most of us escaped from them in the 1970s to live independent lives. We don't want to go back.\". The Baroness is a wheelchair user with the muscle wasting condition spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). According to the Local Government Association (LGA) about 70,000 people in England use PAs. It described the current lack of workers as \"severe\" in a recent . report. . In the latest . Access All podcast. , Nikki Fox discusses Baroness Campbell's fear with Anna and Katy who are experiencing their own PA challenges. And disabled comedian Rosie Jones chats about the frustration at being turned away from gay nightclubs by bouncers who think she's too disabled to be gay or that her wobbliness means she's drunk. PAs are recruited after someone is given a care needs assessment by the local authority. If someone doesn't pay for the care privately, the authority considers and allocates the number of hours they need support for and assigns a budget to pay for it. This is either managed by the local authority as home help or the individual can opt for direct payments where money goes into a bank account and the disabled person arranges their own assistance. The latter gives the individual more control over who cares for them and the jobs they do, but it also turns them into an employer with all the legal and practical issues that involves, including recruitment. Anna, who uses a wheelchair due to an energy impairment, has been awarded a budget for 35 hours a week of PA support, but after her last PA left in June, she's found no-one to replace her. \"You're putting up adverts and it's just tumbleweed,\" she says. . She describes her PAs as \"my hands\". \"They help if I cook a meal or I make my Christmas cake. They'll open the door that I can't open because it's too heavy.\". There are other, incidental, tasks they help with too. Like the weeks of frustration she felt when her bedroom clock stopped and she couldn't reach the battery. . But it has knock on effects for personal care and wellbeing too with Anna saying she can only shower once a week currently without support from a PA because she doesn't have the energy to do more for herself. Without that support, Anna says it feels like she's living a \"temporary life\" having to stop lots of activities she enjoys because she can't manage them alone. She continues to try and recruit assistants but feels she's been let down one too many times, and recently turned to Twitter to vent her frustration. \"Had a new PA start and she was terrible and then quit with no notice after a week and a half,\" she tweeted. Anna believes something has happened to the market and availability of people who want or value this kind of job. . Many people point to one particular moment in recent history which they feel changed the landscape of PA work and availability - Brexit. PAs are not currently recognised as \"skilled workers\" and, after Brexit, are no longer eligible to work in the UK. Baroness Campbell said: \"We need workers from Europe to be able to return to this country to make up the shortage of personal assistants.\" . In 2021, the government's Migration Advisory Committee recommended care workers were added to the occupation shortage list. But as individuals are unable to sponsor workers for a visa, only organisations can, this isn't a quick fix either. Katy Etherington also has SMA and uses a wheelchair. She works as a graphic designer and was motivated to set-up PA Pool in 2007 because PA recruitment was the \"bane of my life\". Like a dating site, PA Pool matches PAs with clients who have compatible personalities. It currently has about 22,000 members nationwide, but the number of people needing a PA now far outweighs available assistants.  . She said that prior to Brexit, a third of her PAs came from Europe who would often commute over every few weeks to do a block of work with her. The job requires a particular kind of person. It can feel as though you're living someone else's life and so the career span can be quite short. Europeans would often choose to do it to learn English whilst also getting paid. Katy says: \"British people aren't quite so suited to this kind of work because they have their own life here. It's very difficult to distance yourself from your life when it's literally just down the road.\". The LGA found low pay or a lack of sick and holiday pay were some of the main reasons people leave the job. Regular turnover means recruitment can be an ongoing process - but there is little interest in becoming a PA. Katy says: \"We've seen PAs say that they've left to go and work in a coffee house or as a dog walker because they earn more.\". In July, the LGA recommended the budgets should take local market conditions into consideration rather than only offering the minimum wage of \u00a39.50 an hour to a PA, to alleviate this kind of problem. The Department of Health and Social Care said it has plans to \"bolster recruitment and retention\" of personal assistants. \"We have also delivered a national recruitment campaign highlighting different adult social care roles, with planning for the next campaign underway,\" it said. . But Katy thinks there are more simple ways to improve the situation. She says the job comes with great opportunities that need to be shouted about. . \"It's not just about helping someone get up in the morning. It could be going on a four month cruise around the world, which is what I did with my PA. . \"We need to inspire people to become PAs. You get to do things that you never would normally do.\". Anna believes disabled people need to become better at selling the idea of what a PA is so people understand, rather than assume, what the role involves. . \"If there were genuine voices of disabled people at every level [of policy making], then I think we would be in a better position to try and find solutions together.\". Anna has had some good news herself in recent days. Someone has come forward and might be available to support her for two mornings a week. . She's trying not to raise her hopes, but even this will make a huge difference to her life. You can listen to the podcast and find information and support on the . Access All page. ."},

{"a": "China has faced criticism for its lending practices to poorer countries, accused of leaving them struggling to repay debts and therefore vulnerable to pressure from Beijing. But that is rejected by China, which accuses some in the West of promoting this narrative to tarnish its image. It says: \"There is not a single country that has fallen into [a] so-called 'debt trap' as a result of borrowing from China.\". China is one of the world's largest single creditor nations. . Its loans to lower and middle-income countries have tripled over the past decade, reaching $170bn (\u00a3125bn) by the end of 2020. . However, China's overall lending commitments are likely to be significantly greater than these figures suggest. Research by AidData, an international development body at William & Mary University in the US, finds that half of China's lending to developing countries is not reported in official debt statistics. It is often kept off government balance sheets, directed to state-owned companies and banks, joint ventures or private institutions, rather than directly from government to government.  . There are now more than 40 low and middle-income countries, according to AidData, whose debt exposure to Chinese lenders is more than 10% of the size of their annual economic output (GDP) as a result of this \"hidden debt\". Djibouti, Laos, Zambia and Kyrgyzstan have debts to China equivalent to at least 20% of their annual GDP. . Much of the debt owed to China relates to large infrastructure projects like roads, railways and ports, and also to the mining and energy industry, under President Xi Jinping's . Belt and Road Initiative. .  . In an interview with the BBC, Richard Moore, the head of Britain's foreign intelligence agency MI6, said China uses what he called \"debt traps\" to gain leverage over other countries. . The claim is that China lends money to other countries, which end up having to cede control of key assets if they can't meet their debt repayments - an accusation that's been long denied by Beijing. One example often cited by critics of China is Sri Lanka, which years ago embarked on a massive port project in Hambantota with Chinese investment. . But the billion dollar project using loans and contractors from China became mired in controversy, and struggled to prove viable, .  leaving Sri Lanka saddled with growing debts. Finally, in 2017, Sri Lanka agreed to give state-owned China Merchants a controlling 70% stake in the port on a 99-year lease in return for further Chinese investment. . Analysis of the port project by UK-based think tank Chatham House . has questioned whether the \"debt trap\" narrative strictly applies. , given that the deal was driven by local political motivations, and that China never took formal ownership of the port. It points out that a large proportion of Sri Lanka's overall debt was owed to non-Chinese lenders, and that there's no evidence China has taken advantage of its position to gain strategic military advantage from the port. Despite that, there's little doubt China's economic involvement in Sri Lanka has grown in the past decade, and concerns persist that this could be used to advance its political ambitions in the region. There are other parts of the world where Chinese lending has also proved controversial, with contracts whose terms could give China leverage over important assets. But there are no cases, among the hundreds of loan arrangements studied by AidData and some other researchers, of Chinese state-owned lenders actually seizing a major asset in the event of a loan default. China does not publish records of its foreign loans, and the majority of its contracts contain non-disclosure clauses which prevent borrowers from revealing their contents. . It argues that such confidentiality is common practice.  for international loan contracts. \"Confidentiality agreements are very common in international commercial loans\", says Professor Lee Jones at Queen Mary University of London. . \"And much of China's development financing is fundamentally a commercial operation.\". Most of the major industrialised nations share information about their lending activities through membership of what's known as the Paris Club.  . China has chosen not to join this grouping, but using available World Bank data, the rapid growth in China's reported lending compared to others can be clearly observed. China tends to lend at higher rates of interest than western governments. At around 4%, these loans are close to commercial market rates and about four times that of a typical loan from the World Bank or an individual country such as France or Germany. The required repayment period for a Chinese loan is also generally shorter - less than 10 years, compared to around 28 years for other lenders' concessional loans to developing countries. Chinese state-owned lenders also typically require borrowers to maintain a minimum cash balance in an offshore account to which the lender has access. . \"If a borrower fails to repay its debt,\" says Brad Parks, Executive Director of AidData, \"China can simply debit funds from [this] account without having to collect on bad debt through a judicial process.\". This approach is rarely seen in loans issued by western lenders. There's currently an initiative by G20 nations - those countries which have the largest and fastest-growing economies - to offer debt relief for poorer countries to help them deal with the impact of the pandemic. . China has joined this and says it has contributed \"the highest amount of debt repayment\" of any country taking part in the plan. The World Bank says that since May 2020, a total of more than $10.3bn has been delivered in debt relief by G20 countries under this scheme. But when we asked the World Bank for a breakdown by country, it said it could not share the information."},

{"a": " A family of six have been living in a one-bedroom flat because the social housing they were assigned was inaccessible to their disabled child. Seven-year-old Joel Verala uses a wheelchair and is fed by a tube due to quadriplegic cerebral palsy. The house has three bedrooms but the family have been told the adaptations he needs could take a year. . Croydon Council said it had always informed the family the work would take \"some months to complete\". . Joel's mum, Souskay Verala, describes her son as a \"happy boy\" on the . BBC Access All podcast. . \"He likes stories read to him, he loves his siblings playing around him, as well as walks outside,\" she says. The family - Souskay, her husband and three children - were excited to be offered the three-bedroom council property in March having lived in a small flat for the previous six years. But, though the new house was described as \"suitable\" for their needs, they maintain it needs adapting before Joel can live there. That includes a lift between floors, widened doors to enable his wheelchair to move through rooms, ramps into the property and hoists. The planning application for the work is yet to be approved and the Veralas have been told it could take at least another 12 months for the work to be completed. . The council said the family could move in as Joel could stay on the ground floor. It said: \"We worked closely with this family, their doctors, and our children's social care and housing teams to find them the right home. We continue to work with them so they can make full use of their new home and are committed to progressing necessary works.\" . In the latest . Access All podcast. , Nikki Fox discusses Joel's access needs and the family's difficult housing situation with mum Souskay Verala. Paralympic skier Millie Knight talks about her new sporting venture - making the England team in karate. She explains how she tackles both sports with 5% vision. . And Nikki goes to the blue badge queue where disabled people are queuing to see the Queen lying in state. . Souskay says the family felt they had no choice but to accept the new bigger house and move out of their original small home. \"We didn't want to go there, but we have been waiting for so long [for a house],\" she says. . But despite already paying rent and council tax on the property given to them, the family felt they could not move in while it remained inaccessible to their son and would prevent him from thriving.  . Instead, the family of five moved in to the one-bedroom flat where Souskay's mother lives. . As well as having six people in the small property, space is further compromised by Joel's sizeable medical equipment, including wheelchair and specialist bed. \"It's very difficult for me to see my mum like that. She has a bad back and knees and she's sleeping on the sofa,\" Souskay says. \"It's very stressful and I'm very anxious.\". Christina McHale, from housing association Habinteg which specialises in accessible and adaptable properties for disabled people, says living in an accessible property is crucial to someone's quality of life and development. \"Frequently we hear about the transformational effect that it has on people's health and wellbeing at whatever age they are, and the independence and dignity which comes from having a home that meets their needs.\". Souskay is also worried about the impact their housing situation is having on her two other, younger, children. She had moved them to a school closer to the new property but, as they don't yet live there, it presently means a journey of more than 30 minutes each way. And while her husband works full-time, Souskay is Joel's main carer. . Christina says when it comes to children's access requirements, not enough thought is always given to the fact children grow and their needs change rapidly. . Souskay is not alone in facing such predicaments. While Croydon Council is footing the bill for Joel's adaptations, lots of disabled people use a Disabled Facilities Grant (DFG) to fund necessary enabling changes. Grants of up to \u00a330,000 can be awarded in England. . Legally, the work should be completed within 12 months, but for many the process takes far longer. . In 2020, national disability charity Leonard Cheshire found 67% of councils failed to complete the work within a year while 23% took longer than two years. . And in 2018, the Equality and Human Rights Commission found that the average waiting time for an accessible property was 25 months. . Habinteg has been working with Homefinder UK, a non-profit organisation focused on matching social housing with the right people to try and improve the current situation. . They have recently developed the Accessible Now register which Homefinder's CEO, Ninesh Muthiah, describes as a way \"to improve access to either fully wheelchair accessible social housing or partially adapted housing\". . It uses occupational therapists to assess the properties before they are advertised and matched with people who need the adaptations available, although it can mean relocating out of area which is not always welcome, especially if you have a well established support network. But Ninesh says, nationally, there are currently big \"barriers\" to accessing adequate social housing. \"Supply is the biggest challenge,\" he says. \"There's been a lot of issues post-Covid and post-Brexit because organisations can't do repairs 'as quickly as possible' and they can't get materials or labour.\" . But changes are on the horizon. . Earlier this year the government announced that all newly built properties must meet the \"accessible and adaptable\" criteria, sometimes known as the Lifetime Home Standard. . This includes building properties with wider doorframes for wheelchairs to get through, strong bathroom walls for rails to be fitted as residents age and in larger properties the ability to convert the downstairs toilet into a wet room. . But for Souskay the changes have come too late and the situation is having a huge impact on her entire family. \"I love my mum. But we need our space. I want to feel that I have a family and I have a place on my own, and I enjoy being there.\". You can listen to the podcast and find information and support on the . Access All page. ."},

{"a": "We've looked into some of the most widely shared false vaccine claims - everything from alleged plots to put microchips into people to the supposed re-engineering of our genetic code. . The fear that a vaccine will somehow change your DNA is one we've seen aired regularly on social media. The BBC asked three independent scientists about this. They said that the coronavirus vaccine would not alter human DNA. Some of the newly created vaccines, including . the one now approved in the UK developed by Pfizer/BioNTech,.  use a fragment of the virus's genetic material - or messenger RNA. \"Injecting RNA into a person doesn't do anything to the DNA of a human cell,\" says Prof Jeffrey Almond of Oxford University. . It works by giving the body instructions to produce a protein which is present on the surface of the coronavirus. . The immune system then learns to recognise and produce antibodies against the protein. . This isn't the first time we've looked into claims that a coronavirus vaccine will supposedly alter DNA. . We investigated a popular video spreading the theory.  back in May. . Posts have noted that messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine technology \"has never been tested or approved before\". . It is true that no mRNA vaccine has been approved before now, but multiple studies of mRNA vaccines in humans have taken place over the last few years. And, since the pandemic started, the vaccine has been tested on tens of thousands of people around the world and has gone through a rigorous safety approval process.  . Like all new vaccines, it has to undergo rigorous safety checks before it can be recommended for widespread use. In Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials, vaccines are tested in small numbers of volunteers to check they are safe and to determine the right dose. . In Phase 3 trials they are tested in thousands of people to see how effective they are. The group who received the vaccine and a control group who have received a placebo are closely monitored for any adverse reactions - side-effects. Safety monitoring continues after a vaccine has been approved for use. Next, a conspiracy theory that has spanned the globe. It claims that the coronavirus pandemic is a cover for a plan to implant trackable microchips and that the Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates is behind it. There is no vaccine \"microchip\" and there is no evidence to support claims that Bill Gates is planning for this in the future. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation told the BBC the claim was \"false\". Rumours took hold in March when Mr Gates said in an interview that eventually \"we will have some digital certificates\" which would be used to show who'd recovered, been tested and ultimately who received a vaccine. He made no mention of microchips. This led to one widely shared article headlined: \"Bill Gates will use microchip implants to fight coronavirus.\". The article makes reference to a study, funded by The Gates Foundation, into a technology that could store someone's vaccine records in a special ink administered at the same time as an injection. However, the technology is not a microchip and is more like an invisible tattoo. It has not been rolled out yet, would not allow people to be tracked and personal information would not be entered into a database, says Ana Jaklenec, a scientist involved in the study. The billionaire founder of Microsoft has been the subject of many false rumours during the pandemic. . He's been targeted because of his philanthropic work in public health and vaccine development. . Despite the lack of evidence, in May a . YouGov poll of 1,640 people.  suggested 28% of Americans believed Mr Gates wanted to use vaccines to implant microchips in people - with the figure rising to 44% among Republicans. We've seen claims that vaccines contain the lung tissue of an aborted fetus. This is false. \"There are no fetal cells used in any vaccine production process,\" says Dr Michael Head, of the University of Southampton. One particular video that was posted on one of the biggest anti-vaccine Facebook pages refers to a study which the narrator claims is evidence of what goes into the vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University. But the narrator's interpretation is wrong - the study in question explored how the vaccine reacted when introduced to human cells in a lab. Confusion may have arisen because there is a step in the process of developing a vaccine that uses cells grown in a lab, which are the descendants of embryonic cells that would otherwise have been destroyed. The . technique was developed in the 1960s. , and no fetuses were aborted for the purposes of this research. Many vaccines are made in this way, explains Dr David Matthews, from Bristol University, adding that any traces of the cells are comprehensively removed from the vaccine \"to exceptionally high standards\". The developers of the vaccine at Oxford University say they worked with cloned cells, but these cells \"are not themselves the cells of aborted babies\". The cells work like a factory to manufacture a greatly weakened form of the virus that has been adapted to function as a vaccine. But even though the weakened virus is created using these cloned cells, this cellular material is removed when the virus is purified and not used in the vaccine. We've seen arguments against a Covid-19 vaccine shared across social media asking why we need one at all if the chances of dying from the virus are so slim. A meme shared by people who oppose vaccination put the recovery rate from the disease at 99.97% and suggested getting Covid-19 is a safer option than taking a vaccine. To begin with, the figure referred to in the meme as the \"recovery rate\" - implying these are people who caught the virus and survived - is not correct. About 99.0% of people who catch Covid survive it, says Jason Oke, senior statistician at the University of Oxford. So around 100 in 10,000 will die - far higher than three in 10,000, as suggested in the meme. However, Mr Oke adds that \"in all cases the risks very much depend on age and do not take into account short and long-term morbidity from Covid-19\". It's not just about survival. For every person who dies, there are others who live through it but undergo intensive medical care, and those who suffer . long-lasting health effects. . This can contribute to a health service overburdened with Covid patients, competing with a hospital's limited resources to treat patients with other illnesses and injuries. Concentrating on the overall death rate, or breaking down the taking of a vaccine to an individual act, misses the point of vaccinations, says Prof Liam Smeeth of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. It should be seen as an effort by society to protect others, he says. \"In the UK, the worst part of the pandemic, the reason for lockdown, is because the health service would be overwhelmed. Vulnerable groups like the old and sick in care homes have a much higher chance of getting severely ill if they catch the virus\".

{"a": "A cargo ship carrying grain from a Russian-occupied region of Ukraine has been detained by Turkish customs authorities, according to Ukraine's ambassador to Turkey. Vasyl Bodnar says \"We have full co-operation. The ship is currently standing at the entrance to the port, it has been detained by the customs authorities of Turkey\". We've tracked the Russian-flagged ship, the Zhibek Zholy, on its route from the Ukrainian port of Berdyansk, to Karasu on the Turkish Black Sea coast. It is not clear where its cargo came from or how it was obtained, but Russia has been accused of stealing grain from areas of Ukraine it controls - allegations Russia denies. Berdyansk is in Ukraine's southern Zaporizhzhia region, on the Sea of Azov. . News of the ship's departure from Berdyansk was announced on social media app Telegram by Yevhen Balytskyi, who was recently appointed by Russia as governor of the occupied areas of Zaporizhzhia. Mr Balytskyi said 7,000 tonnes of grain would be sent to \"friendly\" countries. He added that ships from Russia's Black Sea Fleet would be \"ensuring the security\" of the journey, and that the port had been cleared of sea mines. He later edited the post, taking out references to the ship's cargo and destination. . A video news report about the departure of the ship has also been shared on several pro-Kremlin Telegram channels showing it along with a Russian naval vessel in a harbour, which was identified as Berdyansk by the reporter. . Comparing the video footage with satellite imagery of the port, we have been able to confirm that it was filmed in Berdyansk.  . The weather conditions in the video and the angle of the shadows along the harbour suggest it was filmed on the morning of 28 June. Some features along the ship's hull, such as its name, were blurred out in the video. But we have confirmed that the ship that left Berdyansk is the same one now lying off the Turkish coast, based on images from the Telegram posts as well as eyewitness accounts given to a Ukrainian shipping expert. We have also been able to track the earlier movements of the Zhibek Zholy as it made its way towards Ukraine to pick up its cargo. On 22 June it travelled from Turkey, dropping off its cargo at the Russian port of Novorossiysk.  As it then approached the Ukrainian coast, its tracking signal was lost - suggesting it had been switched off. . The signal only reappeared on 29 June as it headed back south away from the Ukrainian coast. This tracker also reports the depth at which the ship lies in the water - and it indicated that the ship had taken on cargo. . Michelle Bockmann, a markets editor at Lloyd's List Intelligence, believes this is \"suspicious\" behaviour. . She says many cargo ships turn off their trackers for part of their journeys in the Sea of Azov, but most resume their transmissions when they reach their intended port. It's not clear whether the ship intends to unload its cargo in the Turkish port of Karasu or continue its journey south through the Bosphorus Strait to an, as yet, unknown destination. . The registered owner of the Zhibek Zholy, a Kazakh-based company called KTZ Express, has told the Reuters news agency that the ship has been chartered by a Russian company. It added that it was consulting the parties involved and would abide by all sanctions and restrictions. .

{"a": "Chinese President Xi Jinping says his country has reached the ambitious goal set when he assumed office in 2012 of lifting 100 million people out of poverty. But what has China actually achieved?. We've compared the Chinese data with global poverty figures compiled by the World Bank. Poverty is defined by China as anyone in rural areas earning less than about $2.30 a day (adjusted for inflation). It was fixed in 2010 and looks at income but also living conditions, healthcare and education. . Provinces have been racing to reach the goal. Jiangsu, for example, announced in January last year that only . 17 of its 80 million residents still lived in poverty. . . The national benchmark used by the Chinese government is slightly higher than the $1.90 a day poverty line used by the World Bank to look at poverty globally. Using these figures gives us a better standard measurement used by the World Bank across all countries. In 1990 there were more than 750 million people in China living below the international poverty line - about two-thirds of the population. By 2012, that had fallen to fewer than 90 million, and by 2016 - the most recent year for which World Bank figures are available - it had fallen to 7.2 million people (0.5% of the population). So clearly, even in 2016 China was well on the way to reaching its target. This suggests that overall, 745 million fewer people were living in extreme poverty in China than were 30 years ago. . World Bank figures do not take us to the present day, but the trend is certainly in line with the Chinese government's announcement. . Elsewhere in the region, Vietnam has also seen a dramatic fall in extreme poverty rates over a similar period. . Another large country, India, had 22% of its population living below the international poverty line in 2011 (the most recent data available). Brazil has 4.4% of its people earning less than $1.90 a day. China's rapid reduction in poverty went hand in hand with a long period of sustained economic growth. Much of the focus has been on the poorest rural areas. . The government has relocated millions of people from remote villages into apartment complexes. Sometimes these were built in towns and cities, but sometimes new villages were built near the old ones. But there has been criticism that people had little choice over whether to move homes, or jobs. Some also point out that the reason rural poverty was so widespread was because of Communist Party policies in the first place. \"There is no doubt something absolutely extraordinary has happened over the last 40 years,\" says the Economist's David Rennie. . However, this success in bringing people out of abject poverty is not simply down to the government, he says. \"Chinese people, by working extremely hard, lifted themselves out of poverty - in part because some of the stupidest economic policies ever created, by Chairman Mao, were abandoned in favour of versions of capitalism.\". Mao Zedong, who founded the People's Republic of China in 1949, oversaw attempts to industrialise the country's peasant economy in the 1950s. His disastrous Great Leap Forward, which began in 1958, forced farmers into communes, leading to . mass starvation in the countryside. . While China has made substantial work of tackling the deepest poverty first, should it be holding itself to a higher standard?. For example, the World Bank draws a higher poverty line for upper-middle-income countries, which tries to reflect economic conditions. It sets this at $5.50 a day. China is now an upper-middle-income country, says the bank. About a quarter of China's population is in poverty, according to this metric. For comparison, this is slightly higher than Brazil. And there is widespread income inequality. Last year, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said China still had 600 million people whose monthly income was barely 1,000 yuan ($154). He said that was not enough to rent a room in a city. However, by any measure China has made huge strides to lift millions out of the toughest standards of living over the last few decades.

{"a": "A satellite image of Bucha in Ukraine appears to show bodies lying in the street nearly two weeks before the Russians left the town. The image from 19 March, first reported by the New York Times and confirmed by the BBC, directly contradicts Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov's claim that footage of bodies in Bucha, that has emerged in recent days, was \"staged\" after the Russians withdrew.  . The satellite image shows objects that appear to be bodies in the exact locations where they were subsequently found by Ukrainian forces when they regained control of the town north of Kyiv.  . Along another section of the road, the image shows what appear to be more bodies on the ground. There is an earlier satellite image available from Maxar on 11 March.

Russia has claimed it shows \"fake dead bodies\" and was \"staged\" after its troops left the town. We compared the car footage with the satellite imagery of Bucha from 19 March (when the Russians were in control). In both, there are bodies lying in the same parts of the road (marked in red) and near vehicles (marked in yellow). Pro-Russian social media accounts also . circulated a slowed-down version of the footage on the same road. , claiming that the arm on one of the bodies moved. . The video is grainy but a closer analysis of it shows that what is claimed to be a moving arm, is actually a mark in the bottom right corner of the vehicle's windscreen. We've circled this mark - which looks like a raindrop or a speck of dirt - along with similar marks visible on the windscreen earlier in the video. Another Russian claim focuses on a different part of the footage. The car passes another body, lying next to a pavement with red and yellow stones and shattered brown fencing. . As it drives on, the body can be seen briefly in the right-hand wing mirror. Pro-Russian accounts claim the body \"sits up\". But a slowed-down version of the video shows the wing mirror is clearly distorting the reflection of the body, as well as houses in the background. The same effect can be seen in videos of . similar wing mirrors posted on the internet. . . The BBC has matched both bodies from the video (posted on 2 April) with high-resolution photos provided by Getty Images and AFP on 3 April. In the video, the first body is lying on their back near a white and yellow kerb. The pavement to the right is part asphalt and part grass. A silver car can be seen on the pavement with its boot open in front of a white fence. . The same car, kerb, pavement and fence are visible in the Getty/AFP image. The second body has a black jacket and what appears to be a bloodied tourniquet or bandage on the right arm. They are lying on their side next to a red and yellow pavement, in front of a shattered brown fence. . The black jacket, tourniquet/bandage, pavement and fence all match the photo of the body published by Getty/AFP. A pro-Russian social media account, Rybar, says the Maxar satellite images shown in this article were not taken on 19 March - but on 1 April,  the day after Russian forces departed. Russia has made unfounded claims the killings were carried out by Ukrainians, but if the bodies were there on 19 March as the satellite images show, that cannot be the case.  At that time Russia controlled the area. Rybar says its conclusions are based on an analysis of shadows from images downloaded from the Maxar database, revealing the date and time at which the photograph was taken. We contacted Maxar, who said it appeared Rybar had used the company's image search tools wrongly, and that if correctly used, the images can clearly be shown to be from 19 March. The BBC has also checked this analysis, comparing images from three separate companies (PlanetLab, Apollo Mapping and Maxar) taken from the available satellite imagery over this period.  . We've determined that the lengths of the shadows (and therefore the angle of the sun) is consistent with the satellite images having been taken on the morning of 19 March and not on 1 April. Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs tweeted: \"It is of particular worry that all the bodies of the people whose images have been published by the Kiev regime are not stiffened after at least four days.\" . According to the Ukrainian military, the Russians left in the early hours of 31 March. The Russians say they left on 30 March. In the hours after death, bodies go through a process called rigor mortis where muscles contract and stiffen. . We asked a forensic pathologist for their opinion on whether a body would be expected to be \"stiffened\" after four days. One who has worked in places including Kosovo and Rwanda on war crimes investigations, who did not want to be named, told the BBC that by four days rigor mortis has \"usually subsided\". The Russian tweet also claimed that the bodies \"have no typical cadaver stains\". It's not clear what this means but the pathologist said the appearance of someone who has died from a gunshot wound or other act of violence will vary widely depending on the weapon used, from what distance they were shot and so on. . There isn't always a lot of visible blood as it may pool underneath people or soak into heavy clothing, especially if someone is dressed for cold weather. The tweet could be referring to the fact the blood within your body pools downwards after death as it stops circulating around the body, which can lead the skin to turn reddish or purple. . But if someone is lying down, the site of this blood pooling and discolouration may well not be visible from an image alone. The Russian defence ministry claimed that while Bucha was under Russian control \"not a single local resident has suffered from any violent action\". . This claim, however, contradicts numerous eyewitness accounts from residents. A local teacher . told Human Rights Watch . on 4 March that Russian forces had rounded up five men and summarily executed one of them. . Local residents who spoke to the Russian investigative website The Insider painted a similar picture. \"These were horrific days. When neither your courtyard, your house or even your life belongs to you. There is no electricity, water, gas. It's forbidden to leave the house, if you leave - you get shot,\" . local resident Kristina told The Insider. . . Locals told the BBC.  that the Russians had systematically broken down doors to loot flats, and, while soldiers stole valuables and food, residents were forced to sit in the cellar.

{"a": "In the uneasy period between Kenya's presidential election last week and the much anticipated declaration of the final official result, social media platforms have been flooded with conflicting claims over who has won. . It's a country where political twists and turns are very much guided by influential online pundits with large followings on platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. With concrete information hard to come by, misinformation and exaggeration has been the order of the day particularly as it's a very tight race between Deputy President William Ruto and long-time opposition leader Raila Odinga. So in the world of social media speculation, both candidates have already been declared the winner. . Twitter has placed labels on some posts warning users to wait for the official result. There have already been claims of politicians losing their seats only for them later to be announced as winners. As in many countries, influential bloggers and politicians in Kenya help political parties bypass mainstream media channels and connect directly with potential supporters. . For many, this has been the main source of information during the election campaigns and a means of mobilising support. Election observers and monitoring groups have expressed concern at the scale of the false and misleading information being spread. . Some posts are falsely claiming fraud at polling stations, such as this one from a Ruto supporter suggesting a voter turnout of over 100% in an area with strong traditional support for Raila Odinga. The Tweet is partially correct. There is indeed a discrepancy on the returning officer's declaration form.  . However, referring back to the official voter registration data shows that the number of registered voters should be 632 and not 362.  . The error at the local level makes no difference to the number of votes recorded, and indicates that the turnout at this polling station was about 62%. On the other side, Mr Odinga's supporters have been having a go at their opponents online. . In this Tweet, for example, a long-standing disagreement over the use of an electronic system is highlighted by pointing out that Mr Ruto's running mate, Rigathi Gachagua (whose coalition opposed the use of a manual register) had difficulties registering at a polling station using the electronic method. While the electronic kit initially had problems identifying Mr Gachagua, it eventually worked after he rubbed his finger on his hair allowing him to vote. For those trying to locate reliable sources of election information it's all too easy to fall into the trap of fake accounts pretending to be those of official electoral bodies. A Twitter account calling itself IEBC Tabulation has been posting election results and using the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission's official logo as the profile picture and cover image. To confuse further, the account linked directly to the authentic election website.  However, a deeper look quickly revealed not only clear political bias, but also that it had recently been posting a stream of sexually explicit content. This account has now been suspended for violating Twitter rules. One attempt at misleading voters appeared on election day itself, suggesting that votes had already been tallied in an overseas polling station in Sydney, Australia and that Mr Odinga had received the most votes. Variations of this message, presumably designed to energise supporters to get out and vote, circulated on WhatsApp, Twitter and Facebook. However, it was all made up. There were no Kenyan diaspora polling stations in Australia. . The electoral commission says voting by the diaspora was taking place in 12 locations: Burundi, Tanzania, Rwanda, Uganda, South Africa, United Kingdom, Canada, USA, South Sudan, Qatar, UAE, and Germany. Australia wasn't one of them."},

{"a": "President Putin has addressed a military parade in Moscow to mark victory over Nazi Germany in 1945, and made a number of claims about Ukraine and Nato. We've checked some of the things he said. President Putin has repeatedly said Ukraine plans to acquire nuclear weapons as a justification for Russia's invasion, although there's no evidence this is the case. When it was part of the former Soviet Union, Ukraine did have nuclear weapons, but gave these up in the 1990s in return for security guarantees from the US, UK and Russia. Last year, the Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, suggested if Ukraine couldn't join Nato, it might have to reconsider its nuclear-free status. . \"Either we are part of an alliance such as Nato... or we have the only option - to arm by ourselves, and maybe think about nuclear status again.\". However, the Ukrainian government has not expressed an intention to acquire nuclear weapons and a military strategy document published last year did not refer to them. A report by the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists in March noted that even if Ukraine wanted nuclear weapons, it would face major logistical and technical challenges . in creating weapons-grade nuclear material and having the means to deliver it. It would also mean Ukraine breaking its obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which it joined in 1994. This bars countries which don't have nuclear weapons from acquiring them. The UN's nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), says it has seen no signs in Ukraine \"of the diversion of nuclear material, intended for peaceful activities, for other purposes.\". President Putin has frequently claimed the presence of neo-Nazis in Ukraine as a justification for Russia's invasion. At the last parliamentary election in 2019, support for far-right candidates was just 2% - far lower than in many other European countries.  . Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky is Jewish and members of his family died in the Holocaust. . In the 2019 presidential election which Mr Zelensky won, the main far-right candidate won just 1.6% of the vote. But there have been far-right groups in Ukraine -  the most high-profile is the Azov regiment - elements of which have expressed support for Nazi ideology.  . It was formed to resist Russian-backed separatists, who seized areas of eastern Ukraine in 2014, and was subsequently absorbed as a unit within the Ukrainian military. The term \"Banderites\" refers to supporters of the World War Two nationalist leader Stepan Bandera, who expressed anti-Semitic views and for a time collaborated with Nazi Germany. . He remains a highly controversial figure in Ukraine, some hailing him as a patriotic nationalist, others condemning him for his Nazi sympathies. President Putin appears to be suggesting, not only that Nato has been expanding its influence in the Baltic states which are Nato members - but also inside Ukraine, which is not in Nato. It's true that Nato allies have supported Ukraine with equipment and training since 2014, and they have deployed more forces to some Nato member states in eastern Europe. . Nato stepped up assistance to Ukraine following the annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014, and military trainers from Nato member states have had a presence in the country. . The US had around 150 military trainers in Ukraine (whom it pulled out in February as the threat of a Russian invasion grew), and the UK had at one point a similar number, with other countries having smaller training missions. The US and the UK had supplied limited numbers of anti-tank weapons to Ukraine before the war started, but it's clear that there has been much more foreign military aid flowing to Ukraine in response to Russia's invasion. Nato says that its deployments in eastern Europe after 2014 - four battle groups in the Baltic states and Poland - . amounted to only 5,000 troops.  \"Before Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea, there were no allied troops in the eastern part of the [Nato] alliance,\" it says. It also says that further Nato military activity in eastern Europe has been in response to Russia's own build up near Ukraine, which went on for many weeks before it invaded in late February. . At one point, the Russian forces . were estimated to be anything between 100,000 and 190,000 strong. . Read more from Reality Check. Send us your questions."},

{"a": "Raila Odinga, the losing presidential candidate in Kenya's recent elections, has filed a legal challenge to the result, in which William Ruto was declared the winner. We've been looking into aspects of the legal case Mr Odinga has presented. A key part of Raila Odinga's case hinges on the role of the chair of the Independent Election and Boundaries Commission (IEBC), Wafula Chebukati. Mr Odinga says he should not have announced William Ruto as the winner without the agreement of a majority of the commission, and thus \"usurped\" their role. We know that four of the seven commissioners did not support the announcement of the result. But there are different interpretations of Mr Chebukati's powers. . Some experts say that under the constitution, he alone is empowered to announce the outcome of the presidential poll, acting as the returning officer for that vote. They also point to the fact that he has a legal obligation to do so within seven days of the date of the election. Mr Chebukati announced the results on 15 August, six days after the vote. However, others argue that under Kenya's election rules, Mr Chebukati can only announce what the commission itself has \"tallied and verified\", something Mr Odinga says did not happen. This is a point that the Supreme Court will have to resolve. Mr Odinga's lawyers have filed testimony from anti-corruption campaigner John Githongo, in which he claims to have evidence of widespread, systematic manipulation of the computerised results database. Mr Githongo says a source approached him with evidence that a team of more than 50 people worked to digitally alter results from counting stations in Mr Ruto's favour before uploading them onto the election commission website. Mr Githongo says one of those involved was Dennis Itumbi, a digital strategist working for the declared winner of the election, William Ruto. Reacting to the accusation on Twitter, Mr Itumbi has said: \"The Fiction presented as a serious case! I am reading about myself in what sounds like a wild novel.\". To verify if tampering of the declaration documents has taken place, the forms lodged with the electoral commission will have to be compared with the original hard copies of the forms completed by returning officers at local counting stations. Mr Odinga's legal complaint also highlights what he says are inconsistencies in the official number of people who voted and the percentage given by the election officials for the overall turnout. . Mr Chebukati had initially announced a turnout of 65.4%. Mr Odinga says this turnout figure would mean 14.5m voters must have cast their ballots, based on the total number of registered voters.  . The final official number of valid votes was 14.2m (and even if you add spoiled votes, you would get only around 14.3 million ballots cast), so Mr Odinga's legal team is claiming that \"the commission is unable to account for over 250,000 votes that were cast in the election excluding voters who voted manually.\" . Mr Odinga's sums are correct. However, he's using a figure (65.4%) that Mr Chebukati shortly afterwards corrected to 64.6% - a figure which much more accurately reflects the actual voter turnout. So Mr Odinga can argue that the election commissioner initially made a mistake, but this was quickly corrected by Mr Chebukati on the same day.  . The final official turnout, once all the votes were tallied and verified, was 64.8% of the electorate. On election day, voters were not just electing a new president. They were also voting for governors, senators, MPs, women's representatives and members of county assemblies. Mr Odinga says there were unexplained discrepancies in the total number of votes cast for different positions in the same areas. . He has cited Kirinyaga County in central Kenya, where he claims some 23,000 more people voted for the president than for the governor. We can't be sure where Mr Odinga's figures have come from, or what might account for the difference. But a live stream of the count shows that the returning officer failed to mention just over 22,000 votes for one of the candidates standing in the governor's election. . We confirmed this with a reporter who witnessed the count. In other areas, Mr Odinga's team claims the votes for the president were actually lower than than those for other positions, which they say \"is a practically improbable scenario.\". Variations in the numbers of spoiled ballots might account for some of the difference.  Also, prisoners are only allowed to vote for the president - and not for any other positions - but that wouldn't make a huge difference. There may well turn out to be significant discrepancies, but at this stage it's not possible to identify these with any certainty as not all the data are available from the election commission. ."},

{"a": "One year ago, the Taliban swept into the Afghan capital Kabul, as foreign forces hastily completed their withdrawal. Speaking for the Taliban at the time, Zabihullah Mujahid made a number of pledges for the new government. . So has the regime lived up to its promises?. The previous Taliban regime, in the 1990s, severely curtailed women's freedom - and since the takeover of power by the Taliban last year, a series of restrictions have been re-imposed on women in Afghanistan. . Regulations on clothing and laws forbidding access to public areas without a male guardian have been enforced.  . In March, schools re-opened for a new academic year, but the Taliban reversed an earlier promise and girls are currently not permitted to attend secondary school. . The Taliban has blamed a lack of female teachers and the need to arrange the segregation of facilities. This has affected . an estimated 1.1 million pupils, according to the UN.  and has provoked widespread international criticism. . Primary school education for girls has been permitted. . Some public universities reopened for both men and women in February. But women's participation in the labour force has dropped since the Taliban takeover last summer, according to the World Bank. . Female participation in the labour force had increased from 15% to 22% in just over a decade, between 1998 and 2019. . However, with the Taliban imposing more restrictions on women's movements outside the home since their return to power, the percentage of females working in Afghanistan . shrank to 15% in 2021. . An . Amnesty report in July.  said that the Taliban had \"decimated the rights of women and children\" in Afghanistan.  It highlighted the abuse and torture meted out to some women who had taken part in protests against the new restrictions imposed on them. In June, the UN Security Council reported the Afghan economy had contracted by an estimated 30%-40% since the Taliban takeover in August last year. An assessment by the official body that oversees US-funded reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan concluded that although some international aid continues to flow into the country, economic conditions remain \"dire.\". The suspension of most international aid and the freezing of access to Afghanistan's foreign exchange reserves has had serious economic consequences for the country. . To compensate, the Taliban have sought to increase tax revenue, as well as ramping up coal exports to take advantage of higher global prices.  . A three-month budget announced in January this year showed the Taliban had collected nearly $400 million in domestic revenue between September and December 2021. But experts have raised concerns over the lack of transparency in how these figures were collated. The loss of international support, security challenges, climate-related issues and global food inflation are all contributing to a rapidly deteriorating economic situation. . The Taliban's pledge to tackle opium poppy cultivation mirrors a policy they introduced . with some success.  when they were last in power more than two decades ago. Opium is used to make heroin - and Afghanistan has been, by far, the world's largest source of opium for many years. In April this year, the Taliban announced a ban on the growing of poppies. There's no firm data on how the clampdown has been progressing, although reports from some poppy-growing areas in Helmand province in the south suggest . the Taliban have been forcing farmers to destroy poppy fields. A US official report in July noted that although the Taliban risked losing support from farmers and others involved in the drug trade, they \"appear committed to their narcotics ban\". However, Dr David Mansfield, an expert on Afghanistan's drug economy, points out the main opium poppy crop would already have been harvested by the time the ban was imposed. . \"The second [annual] crop in south-western Afghanistan is typically a small crop... so its destruction... will not have had a significant impact,\" says Dr Mansfield. It's also worth noting that the production and manufacture of other drugs, such as crystal meth, has been growing, . although the Taliban have banned a wild plant (ephedra) used to make it. Although the conflict which brought the Taliban to power is largely over, there were still over 2,000 civilian casualties (700 deaths and over 1,400 injuries) reported between August last year to mid-June this year, . according to UN data. . However, these figures are well down on previous years when the conflict was at its height. . Around 50% of the casualties since August 2021 were attributed to the actions of the Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) group, a branch of the Islamic State group still active in Afghanistan. In recent months, several IS-K attacks have taken place targeting civilians, especially in urban areas with Shia Muslim or other minority populations. . The presence of other anti-Taliban forces, such as the National Resistance Front (NRF) and Afghanistan Freedom Front (AFF), has also grown.  . \"The overall security environment is becoming increasingly unpredictable,\" said the UN in June, citing the presence of at least a dozen separate militant group opposed to the Taliban who are present in the country. There has also been a significant increase in human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings, detentions and torture by the Taliban, according to the UN.  . Between August 2021 and June 2022, it recorded at least 160 extrajudicial killings of former government and security force officials."},

Western countries are trying to cut their dependency on Russian oil and gas following the invasion of Ukraine in February. Russia supplied the EU with . 40% of its natural gas.  last year.   . Germany, Europe's largest economy, was the largest importer in 2021, followed by Italy. In 2021, the UK imported 4% of its needs from Russia, and in June this year, it . imported no Russian gas for the third month in a row. The US doesn't import any gas from Russia. . However, they are affected when Russia restricts supplies to mainland Europe, as this causes global gas prices to rise. . Since February, . the EU has imposed a number of sanction packages on Russia. , including on its energy industry. The Kremlin has said that \"technological problems\" caused by Western sanctions are preventing Russia from supplying gas via the Nord Stream pipeline. It says . a leak has been detected in a turbine. . But a spokesperson for the EU told the BBC the sanctions regime does not affect the technology needed for the transport of gas into Europe. Siemens Energy, which produces the gas turbines, said these type of leaks \"do not normally affect the operation of a turbine\". \"This doesn't seem like a legitimate reason to close a pipeline\", says Ben McWilliams, an energy policy expert at Bruegel. \"I'm as confident as I can be that this is Putin's latest move to manipulate gas prices and put pressure on Europe's energy systems.\". Gazprom has also said missing documents have prevented certain gas turbines being maintained - but Siemens Energy has rejected the suggestion it failed to provide the relevant paperwork. The EU has proposed a price cap on Russian gas. President Putin has threatened to cut off all energy supplies if it takes such a step. The EU has also said it will . cut gas imports from Russia by two-thirds.  within a year, but has stopped short of a total ban. .

Energy advisor Kate Dourian says that \"there aren't enough LNG terminals in Europe. This will be a problem for Germany, particularly.\". The EU has agreed to . ban all Russian oil imports which come in by sea by the end of this year. . . It will allow oil to continue to be imported by pipeline, as a \"temporary measure\" because countries like Hungary and Slovakia depend on it. Some European nations could still have their oil supplies significantly squeezed by the ban. Lithuania and Finland got about 80% of their oil from Russia in November last year, the latest data available. However, EU countries can buy oil from other producers. Earlier this year, the IEA - a club of oil importing countries - agreed to release 120m barrels-worth of crude from their stocks, and President Biden . ordered a major release of oil.  from America's reserves.

{"a": "Europe and parts of China have experienced extreme temperatures this summer, dry conditions in Africa have put millions at risk of starvation, and the American West continues to see a persistent lack of rainfall.  . Scientists say warmer and drier seasons are likely to become the norm, but have these past few months been the driest on record?. One measure of drought conditions used by scientists is based on the level of moisture in the soil as measured by satellite imagery. . We have compared these dry conditions over the past three months to average conditions since the beginning of this century, to build up a picture of how extreme recent weather patterns have been. This data is based on both soil conditions and temperature data to create what is known as a soil moisture anomaly map. We can see that most of Europe has experienced much drier weather this summer than the average for the period 2001 to 2016. Elsewhere, the west of China has been very dry, with many areas experiencing extreme drought. Parts of sub-Saharan Africa and the US are also experiencing critically dry conditions. In Europe, this summer's drought may be the worst the continent has experienced in 500 years, . according to the EU's environmental programme Copernicus. At the peak of the dry spell in late August, almost half of Europe suffered from a \"soil moisture deficit\". Scientists say climate change means Europe will continue to experience more frequent and persistent droughts, and the dry conditions this year have affected agriculture, transport and energy generation. The Rhine, a major river and cargo route, dropped to critically low levels this summer, . causing shipping disruption. The period between June and August was the hottest on record, and a . report by the EU in August.  predicted at least three more months of \"warmer and drier\" days. Europe has experienced droughts in the past, but recent years have seen increasingly hot summers with many high temperature records set. \"We have now had consecutive droughts for the last five years, and this year is the worst Europe-wide drought in hundreds of years,\" says Dr Fred Hattermann, of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. \"It's not just less rain, it's also that it's got much warmer, so the overall soil moisture has decreased.\". This summer, China experienced an extended period of high temperatures that lasted more than two months, the longest since records began in the 1960s, according to China's Meteorological Administration. Extreme heat and a severe lack of rainfall meant China's biggest river, the Yangtze, shrank. During August, there was 60% less rainfall in the river's drainage area than normal, according to official Chinese data. Despite large areas in southern China struggling with drought, heavy rains in northern areas led to flooding. The Liao River in northern China recorded its second highest water level since 1961. . And nationwide, rainfall has steadily increased since 2012, China's annual climate change study says. In July, the Chinese government issued eight drought warnings and more than 13,000 heavy rain warnings. In 2019, there were more than 28 drought warnings and 10,000 heavy rain warnings for the same period. Seeing both extreme wet and dry conditions is a feature of climate change across the globe. \"When areas of drought grow, like in Siberia and western US, that water falls elsewhere in a smaller area, worsening flooding,\" Peter Gleick, a water specialist from the US National Academy of Sciences, says. Drought conditions in eastern Ethiopia, northern Kenya and Somalia have led the UN to warn that some . 22 million people could be at risk of starvation. \"We are now in the third year of very low rainfall coupled with high temperatures in that part of the continent,\" . according to Oxfam. In Somalia, the rainfall in the March to May season was the lowest in the last six decades. And large parts of DR Congo and Uganda have also experienced very dry conditions compared with the average. But measurements of soil moisture also show how in some countries, such as South Sudan, Mauritania and Senegal, there has been severe flooding. Many parts of southern Africa have also experienced much higher than normal levels of rainfall. A World Bank report in 2021.  noted that overall \"relative to 1970-79, the numbers of droughts and floods were nearly threefold and tenfold respectively, by 2010-19\". Drought conditions in the western US have become the norm, with the region experiencing years of drier and hotter weather. In a . report published in February,.  scientists said the last two decades had seen the most extreme drought conditions in 1,200 years in the American west. And this summer, hot and dry weather led to forest fires in several states and water storage levels dropping. Lake Powell, the second largest reservoir in the US which straddles Arizona and Utah, . is at its lowest level since it was filled in the 1960s, according to Nasa. Climate models predict that the region will continue to have far less rainfall than average in the coming decades. Reporting by Tural Ahmedzade, Jake Horton, Peter Mwai and Wanyuan Song.

The Wheels to Work scheme aims to help refugees access training, volunteering and skills opportunities as well as attend English lessons, job interviews, and get to work. Refugee Oksana said the bike is the \"only way she travels\". South Gloucestershire Council has been collecting donated bikes and mending them before giving them on. Wheels to Work has been developed under the Government's Capability Fund to help unemployed and newly employed workers with transport,. Oksana, her husband, Oleh, and their three children, Vladislav, 12, Dmitro, 8, and Stanislav, 9-months, are staying with a host family in Rudgeway, near Bristol, and have benefitted from a new bike. Oleh is using the bike to get to his IT job and his wife is planning on exploring the local area and going to community events to meet new people and improve her English. Oskana said: \"The bike is great, it is my only way to travel. I will be able to go out and go places.\". Vladislav said: \"Mum hasn't really been on a bike for years, so I am going to give her some lessons, she just needs some practice then she will be off. \"We love it here, we love everything about it, and now we can explore more by bike.\".

{"a": "Ukraine's nuclear chief has suggested that United Nations peacekeepers could secure the Zaporizhzhia power station. . The plant has been occupied by Russia since the early days of the war and come under repeated attack, with both sides blaming each other. UN inspectors observed damage at the power station during a visit last week. The inspectors recommended that a security zone be set up immediately to shield the facility, which is Europe's largest, from the fighting. Vladimir Putin has said he trusted the report from the UN's nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), but criticised the agency for not saying Ukraine was to blame for shelling the area. The Russian leader described the IAEA as \"a very responsible international organisation\" which was under pressure. \"Our servicemen are there - are we shooting at our own?\" he asked, in response to claims that Russia could be responsible for shelling at the plant. Shelling continued while the 14-strong IAEA team visited the site and its head, Rafael Grossi, warned of a very real risk of nuclear disaster. Although most of the team left the plant after two days, it said two of its officials would remain there on a permanent basis. In an emergency session of the Security Council, the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres set out steps for the creation of a demilitarised zone around the plant. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed calls by the IAEA for a safety protection zone at Zaporizhzhia. Petro Kotyn, who runs Ukraine's nuclear agency Energoatom, suggested a UN peacekeeping contingent could set up a security zone at Zaporizhzhia and Russian troops withdraw. In its report, . the nuclear agency highlighted the \"extremely stressful conditions\" facing the 907 Ukrainian staff.  working there under Russian military control. . However, the IAEA was careful not to apportion blame to either side. The IAEA's report says that there were Russian military vehicles stationed in two turbine halls and under the overpass connecting the reactor units and includes a photo showing Russian-flagged military trucks with the Z insignia parked inside a large building. . On Wednesday Mr Putin denied that there was any Russian military equipment on-site at Zaporizhzhia. . Separately, the head of Ukraine's nuclear security agency told a news conference that the site is currently disconnected from the electricity grid following shelling and that Ukraine was considering shutting it down for safety reasons. While the nuclear plant is currently able to generate the electricity it needs to run its own cooling systems, should that cease to be the case it would be reliant on back-up diesel-powered generators. The generators require four tanks of diesel a day, Oleh Korikov said, and it would be very difficult to replenish stocks across the front line. Tuesday's report from the IAEA detailed the damage to the plant and said that while continued shelling had not yet triggered a nuclear emergency, it did present a constant threat to safety that \"may lead to radiological consequences with great safety significance\". . There was an urgent need for \"interim measures\" to prevent a nuclear accident caused by military action, it added, saying all relevant parties would have to agree to a \"nuclear safety and security protection zone\" being set up to avoid further damage. The plant lies on the southern bank of the River Dnieper, across the water from Ukrainian-held towns and military positions. . Meanwhile, the UK's Ministry of Defence says fighting has continued in Ukraine on three fronts over the past 24 hours: in the east, in Donbas; in the north around Kharkiv, and in the south around Kherson. The redeployment of Russian forces to southern Ukraine around Kherson has enabled Ukrainian forces to make progress in the Kharkiv region. according to the US-based Institute for the Study of War. The institute suggests Ukrainian forces may have taken a town near Balaklia as Russian troops retreated, blowing up bridges."},

{"a": "In a pine forest at the edge of Izyum the stench of death filled the air as a mass exhumation got under way.  . The earth is giving up its secrets. Ukrainian officials believe war crimes have been committed, which they are determined to document. Around 100 Ukrainian emergency service workers wearing blue plastic coverings dug into the earth, opening makeshift graves. . They are trying to establish the cause of death of hundreds of people buried in a forest at the edge of the city, recently liberated by advancing Ukrainian forces. . Izyum, invaded in April, was used by Russia as a key military hub to supply its forces from the east. The exhumation was conducted mostly in silence, as police and prosecutors looked on. One officer put his head in his hands. Another walked away. Kharkiv regional prosecutor Olexander Ilyenkov says there is no doubt war crimes have been committed here. \"In the first grave, there is a civilian who has a rope over her neck. So we see the traces of torture,\" he told the BBC. . He said almost everyone died because of Russian soldiers. . \"Some of them were killed, some were tortured, some were killed because of Russian Federation air and artillery strikes.\". Ukraine was determined to show this disturbing sight to the world. Convoys of international journalists were brought to watch on. The burial ground - beside an existing cemetery - contains row after row of graves, marked by crude wooden crosses. . Names were written on a few, but most were marked only by a number. The burials here were carried out under the orders of the Russians when they were in control. . Ukrainian police say there are 445 new graves at the site, but some contain more than one body. It's unclear how all of them died. Many are said to be civilians, women and children among them. . Prosecutors say some were killed by Russian shelling and others were victims of a Russian airstrike on an apartment block in March, in which 47 people were killed.  . Officials say one grave contained around 20 soldiers, some with their hands bound and one with a noose around his neck. The body of a man in military uniform was exhumed and zipped into a white body bag. As the graves were opened there were sporadic explosions in the distance as the security forces worked to de-mine the area.  . 72-year-old Hryhorii came to the burial site today to see the grave of his wife, Ludmilla. He told us she was killed on 7 March during heavy shelling in Izyum. He first had to bury her in the yard of their home, then she was reburied in August. Now her remains will be disturbed once again. It's only now, since the Russians have been pushed out, that Ukraine can carry out detailed investigations here, and can determine how many victims the occupiers left behind.  . A woman who lived opposite the forest told us Russians troops had kept locals away from the cemetery. A local man named Maxim appeared at the burial site, asking journalists to record his account of torture. . He said he was detained by the Russians in early September, and released by Ukrainian forces when they arrived in Izyum last Saturday (10 September). He showed us the marks on his wrists caused by handcuffs, and said he had been subjected to electric shocks. . A senior advisor to Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky told the BBC evidence of torture was found in some areas recently retaken by Ukrainian forces. . \"We saw wildly frightened people who were kept without light, without food, without water, and without the right to justice,\" Mykhailo Podolyak said. Kharkiv prosecutor Mr Ilyenkov said several similar burial sites had been found in areas recently retaken by Ukrainian forces. . US national security spokesman John Kirby said reports of the graves in Izyum were \"horrifying\" but \"in keeping with the kind of depravity and the brutality with which Russian forces have been prosecuting this war against Ukraine\". . \"We're going to continue to actively support efforts to document war crimes and atrocities that Russian forces commit in Ukraine and to assist national and international efforts to identify and hold Russians accountable,\" he added. French President Emmanuel Macron condemned \"in the strongest possible terms\" what he described as the \"atrocities\" committed in Izyum. British lawyer Nigel Povoas, who specialises in the prosecution and investigation of major international and transnational crime and who has just returned from Izyum, told the BBC's Newshour he would not be surprised if the exhumations revealed evidence of war crimes. \"I think that the early signs at the moment - although it's very very early - is that some of the bodies have died from shelling or malnutrition and a lack of healthcare,\" he said. \"But as normal bodies are tested and the cause of death determined, I would expect there to be also evidence of torture and executions, because it follows a pattern of what's been happening in the occupied territories.\".

{"a": "A Christmas tree wrapped in suspicious looking wires grows on the lawn near an abandoned village building. It is dangerous to go closer - you can come across a mine anywhere here. So we look through our camera lenses. . False alarm. The wires are not explosives, but the remains of New Year decorations which had not been removed before the Russian invasion on February 24. . We are in the village of Velyki Prohody near the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, 10 kilometres from the Russian border. Over the past weeks, the Ukrainian army, in a rapid offensive, liberated dozens of villages like this one. . But the Russian army has left its mark. On the wall behind the Christmas tree, a large white letter \"Z\" is visible. The sign is everywhere: on old cars, farm equipment, fences, on the walls of gutted houses. Some, though, have now been painted over with fresh paint. In some streets, there is not one single surviving house. There are burnt cars along the roads. A battered armoured vehicle, is rusting in the bushes. Its caterpillar track, placed near the edge of the road, now serves as a speed limiter in front of the checkpoint. . Oleksandr is a pensioner, and a former electrician and mechanic. \"Of course, I'm glad that the village has been liberated. I was a partisan here for six months,\" he says proudly. \"Every day was a war for me. My personal war.\". He stole ammunition from Russian soldiers, put bars of soap into their fuel tanks, and drained diesel from their vehicles. . He suspects that one of the neighbours reported his activities, because he was subjected to regular searches of his house, and twice he was put into \"the pit\". This was a dark basement in the nearby village of Mali Prohody, which served as a prison. He was taken there with a sack on his head. . \"I learned that basement inside out,\" he says. \"I could distinguish people by only their voices. The floor was wet. Nothing to lie on. A few torn tyres, nothing else.\". He says his Russian captors did not seem to care about the conditions in which he was kept. They would bring him food that had gone off. Conditions were overcrowded. . \"You ask them: 'Give me some toilet paper,'\" he says. \"You hear the answer: 'I'll punch you in the face right now.'\". Oleksandr's wife, Lyubov agrees. \"They never address you in a polite way, no matter how old you are.\" . She was also detained by the Russians, not in the basement but in the premises of an abandoned store. . \"Eighteen men in a room and I'm the only woman. Can you imagine? I'm 64 years old. No washing, nothing. It's terrible,\" says Lyubov. . She says she was not tortured or interrogated. But she heard screams through the walls - someone she believes was being electrocuted: \"At first we thought they were torturing a child, because a young voice was screaming. It turned out that it was a woman.\". Other residents of the village also speak about detentions, abuse and forced labour. . We did not find evidence that any civilians were killed here. However, the military showed us the place where Russian soldiers threw the bodies of three Ukrainian soldiers who died in battles at the beginning of the war.  They were left lying on a pile of rubbish among some bushes. . Ukraine says their bodies will be taken for examination and buried with military honours. We see the village council building, where Russian soldiers and officers lived. Judging by the hand-made plaques on the doors, this building served as a military hospital with an isolation room and other wards. An icon of St. Nicholas, Russia's most beloved saint, is hanging on the wall. . There are also two children's drawings. One of them features a red flower and a heart surrounded by five-pointed stars and the letter Z. The other portrays the figure of a girl in headphones, standing on a rainbow, facing the sun, and holding two red hearts in her hands. A grey letter Z is hesitantly drawn in the corner. Their village may be largely in ruins, but Oleksandr and Lyubov radiate joy. \"Now I have nothing to fear. And I am not a chicken-hearted type. I've become even more confident in myself. Had I been younger, I would have gone to the fighting with you,\" Oleksandr brags to some Ukrainian soldiers. I ask how his experiences have changed him. \"I don't even know what to say to you. The hatred for these creatures has increased,\" he says in Russian. Yet immediately he adds: \"But I know that there are decent guys, decent Russians. Of different ages. And they don't want this war. They don't want to shoot.\". Oleksandr says that although most Russians in their village behaved extremely rudely and cruelly, some of them were compassionate. . The soldier who guarded him during his first arrest called him by the informal nickname \"Uncle Sasha\", and told him: \"You are older than my father. Forgive me for what is happening.\". Lyubov has similar conflicted views. She has just called the Russian army \"cattle\" and said that \"they bark at everything.\" . But suddenly she remembers an encounter with a Russian soldier that makes her face light up: \"I have a grandson who is 26 years old. And this one [a soldier] was very young, younger than my grandson. He stands in front of me, thin, small, just a kid. He stands and says: \"Oh, a plum. He has never seen a plum.\". Of the several dozens of farmers who survived the occupation in Velyki Prohody, there are mainly elderly people. There are no children on the streets. No one is hurrying to return to the village. . A wire is stretched at the roadside, hinting at the dangers of leaving the path.The Ukrainian military says mines can be found anywhere here - in the grass, in the bushes, in both destroyed and intact houses. . One of the explosives experts accompanying us pulls a rectangular, bent, sand-coloured box on thin legs from the boot of his car. It is a MON-50 anti-personnel mine that he found in the grass near the village council. Such mines are prohibited by an international convention - although Russia has not signed up to it. \"Imagine, this land is still full of shells from the Second World War,\" he says. As we speak, muffled explosions are heard over the horizon. There is still a lot of work to be done, and it is going on."},

{"a": "It is 03:00 in St Petersburg and the streets are deserted. But in one tiny flat in the centre of the city, two activists are wide awake preparing to do something that can be very dangerous in Russia - stage an anti-war protest. . The pair agreed to meet us, but requested that we protect their identities. \"We do it anonymously, at night, in quiet areas, and we hide from CCTV cameras,\" says one activist, who goes by the nickname Mitya. \"We always have our hoods up and we wear masks. We make our posters in gloves and we hang them up in gloves,\" explains the other, who we will refer to as Vorobei. The Feminist Anti-War Resistance is a secretive protest group that sprang up on the second day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. When we meet Mitya and Vorobei, their protest has taken the form of an anti-war message spray-painted on the pavement outside a school. It is part of a series of actions targeting mothers - who may one day have to send their sons off to war. The activists tell me they were motivated to join the group after being shocked at Russia's actions in Ukraine. \"The war is horrific,\" says Mitya. \"It's a completely senseless, imperialist war that should never have happened. It's all about the vanity of our president, whom we didn't even elect.\". The next morning, we set off to inspect the graffiti that Mitya and Vorobei had painted in front of the school. It is a crisp, clear morning in St Petersburg, and the anti-war message is easily visible to dog walkers in the morning sunshine. But it survived just a few hours before it was painted over. . Vorobei says the group hopes the demonstrations will attract others: \"If someone was indifferent before, if they see our poster or sticker, maybe that person will decide they don't support the war.\". Being an anti-war activist in Russia is dangerous. Rights groups say there have been more than 16,000 detentions across the country for anti-war actions. Very few people now publicly oppose the war. Those who do speak out risk arrest or losing their job, university place or business. \"There were [street] protests against the war in the first week,\" Vorobei explains. \"They were all broken up in the most violent way - the police use tasers, batons, there's complete helplessness. And then you might get tortured in the police station. It's absolutely terrifying,\" says Mitya. The authorities say the vast majority of Russians support what the Kremlin refers to as the \"special military operation\" in Ukraine, and they deny allegations that activists are persecuted. It is very difficult to gauge how many people in Russia oppose the war. Both state polls and those conducted by independent researchers put the level of public support for the military campaign at around 70%. However, critics say opinion polls cannot be trusted in an authoritarian system like Russia, as people often give a dishonest response for fear of repercussions. Russians are often reluctant to talk about politics openly with strangers. Vitaly, though, is one of those Russians who wants to talk. . We travelled to Smolensk, a city in western Russia, to meet him. The 32-year-old former aircraft engineer has staged a public protest in the centre of Smolensk every day since the war began. In seven months, he has missed just three days - when he was either in jail or at a funeral. \"Why do I go out every day? In order to create a chain reaction of protest,\" he says. Vitaly has been arrested, fined and even brutally beaten. But he carries on, and tries to convince others to join him. So far, nobody has. We walk with him to the city centre, where he stands under a fir tree with his anti-war placard. \"Has anything changed? No, but that doesn't mean I'm upset and I'll stop. At the moment I'm still able to do something, I'm not disillusioned yet.\". Vitaly's placard reads in Russian: \"No to the war!\" But he has replaced the first two letters of the word \"war\" with asterisks. In March, shortly after the invasion began, the Russian parliament passed a series of new laws making it illegal to use the words \"war\" or \"invasion\" in relation to Russia's military campaign in Ukraine. . Doing so could land you in prison. \"The fear is very high,\" he says, wearily. \"I have no solution for how to fight this fear. I understand it completely - people have children, jobs. We are silent, and we are afraid. This is what we need to work on - overcoming the fear.\". While we talk, a woman angrily confronts him. She snatches his sign and rips it to pieces, bellowing that he is \"selling the Motherland for money\". . Vitaly carefully picks up the pieces of his sign, then pulls another from his rucksack. He always carries a spare - just in case. I stop passers-by to ask whether they support Vitaly. Many are too scared to speak openly about the war, and almost everyone refuses to give their name. One woman tells me she totally disagrees with Vitaly: \"Russia is doing the right thing [in Ukraine]. Our victory should be total and final.\". But many people in Smolensk clearly support his anti-war stance. We see several locals stop to chat, shake his hand and offer kind words. . A young mother called Kira, out walking with her daughter, agrees to speak to me. \"We support that young man,\" she tells me. \"The war is very bad. It won't bring anything good, not for our country, or for any other.\". Not everyone has been as lucky as Vitaly, who has managed to avoid a long prison sentence - so far. Back in Moscow we went to meet Elena, who wanted to tell us about her son. She shows me his room, untouched since his arrest: \"I really miss him. I miss talking to him.\". Dima Ivanov, 23, is a gifted student from Moscow State University. He ran a popular social media channel, where he posted anti-war material. In April, he was arrested and given serious criminal charges. He faces between five and 10 years in prison. In Russia, over 99% of criminal cases end in a guilty verdict. Hundreds of political activists have left Russia since the military operation began in February. \"I wanted him to leave,\" says Elena, \"but he always refused. He said 'this is my country, why should I leave? I want things to be better here'.\" . Elena begins to cry. \"I didn't want him to end up in prison... it's very difficult for me to think about him suffering.\". Amnesty International has declared Dima a \"prisoner of conscience\". His mother tells me conditions in the detention centre where Dima is awaiting trial are poor. She reads a letter he has written to her, describing his cell: \"It's damp, it's mouldy and the toilets and sinks are broken.\". While few in Russia openly voice their opposition to the war, as the conflict drags on and casualties mount, the Kremlin will be uneasy about the potential for more dissent."},

{"a": "Russian President Vladimir Putin says there are military units in Ukraine \"under the de-facto command of Western advisers\". Claims have also appeared on Russian television and social media channels that Nato troops are actively involved in the war. Nato member countries have been providing weaponry and logistical support, but have said they aren't sending troops into Ukraine, which is not a member of the alliance. We've looked at the evidence provided for these claims of Nato boots on the ground in Ukraine. In his national address on 21 September, President Putin said: \"The Kyiv regime has launched new gangs of foreign mercenaries and nationalists, military units trained to Nato standards and under the de-facto command of Western advisers.\". It's well known that . foreign fighters have joined Ukrainian military units. .  However, claims are being made by Russian officials and media outlets of serving Nato troops on the ground in Ukraine. On 13 September, Ruslan Ostashko, the host of Vremya Pokazhet (Time Will Tell) on Russia's Channel One said: \"In the grand scheme of things, Ukrainian soldiers are there more for appearances, for having photos taken and uploading videos to TikTok, but it's mainly Nato troops fighting there.\" . Throughout the programme, footage taken from social media of foreigners allegedly fighting in Ukraine was shown as \"evidence\" of Nato boots on the ground. Andrei Marochko, a military spokesman for the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic (LPR) in the east of Ukraine, . told Russian state-owned news agency RIA Novosti. : \"Our intelligence agencies revealed the arrival of regular Nato officers in the Kharkiv region. \"The purpose of their trip to this area is to organise interaction between foreign and Ukrainian units.\". Mr Marochko has also told Russian state TV that Nato officers have arrived in Kramatorsk, a city in the Donetsk region of Ukraine. Other claims are more generally about the presence of foreign fighters and don't make the direct connection to Nato - but leave the link implied. . For example, Vladimir Kornilov, a columnist for RIA Novosti, has said there had been a \"dramatic increase in video footage of people who've come to 'liberate' Izyum, with English being spoken.\". It's important to make a clear distinction between those foreign fighters who've travelled independently to Ukraine and troops deployed by Nato member countries. Russian media outlets haven't provided evidence of serving Nato personnel on the ground, only pointing to the presence of individual foreign fighters on the battlefield. . One of the fighters shown on the Vremya Pokazhet television programme is Malcolm Nance, a former US naval officer, who has  regularly posted videos of himself in Ukraine over recent months. One video, highlighted in the TV programme, shows Mr Nance with an artillery battery behind him, firing what he describes as \"the first artillery shot of a massive combined arms, multi-axis ground offensive.\". With over a million followers on Twitter, there's very little that could be considered covert about Mr Nance's presence in Ukraine. . He is not currently serving in the US military and back in April, he shared online that he had joined the Ukrainian Foreign Legion. . A second individual identified in pro-Russian social media posts is another American, Rob-Roy Lane, who grew up in the US state of Idaho. . Mr Lane also regularly posts online videos of himself embedded with a Ukrainian military unit and names several other foreign volunteers in the team. These videos have been widely shared on pro-Russian social media channels. There's no online evidence to suggest he has any previous military experience. The US Department of Defense has not responded to requests for comment about his involvement with American military forces. On his social media account, Mr Lane names several other members in his unit including two British nationals. . \u200b\u200bThe UK's Ministry of Defence said it would not comment on the service records of former personnel, or on their activities in conflict zones. Nato member countries are providing large quantities of . sophisticated weaponry and logistical support to Ukraine. , with the United States by far the largest donor.  . This equipment includes several weapon systems which are believed to have played key roles in the conflict so far, such as long-range rocket launchers and anti-tank weapons. And there has also been Western media speculation that Nato members have been helping both with intelligence and the selection of military targets. There are around 40,000 Nato troops stationed in alliance member countries in the region, such as in the Baltic states and Poland, with another 300,000 troops on high alert in response to Russia's invasion. Extensive training of Ukrainian forces by Nato members has been taking place outside the country, but no Nato member country has said it has contributed military personnel to fight in Ukraine. \"There is no evidence of Nato ground forces participating in Ukraine,\" says Edward Arnold at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), a defence and security think tank. . \"Nor of Nato commanders directing Ukrainian units on the battlefield,\" he adds. \"There is also a very low likelihood of this happening in the future as Nato seeks to mitigate escalation risks.\".

{"a": "Ukrainian forces have made rapid gains in recent days and have recaptured territory in the Russian-occupied Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine.  . However, Russian forces still hold about a fifth of the country. Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, surrounding the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. It also launched attacks in the south, east and north of the country. In early April, Ukrainian forces retook large areas around Kyiv, after Russia abandoned its push towards the capital. Russia has since been focusing its military operations in the south, east and north-east of Ukraine, seizing large areas. However, things changed dramatically at the start of September. In a decisive offensive in the north-east, Ukraine drove back Russian forces. It claims to have regained 3,000 square kilometres (1,158 sq miles) of territory around the city of Kharkiv alone. Its forces have also retaken territory in Luhansk, in eastern Ukraine. Since July, the region had been entirely occupied by Russia. In total, Ukraine says it has retaken more than 8,000 sq km (3,088 sq miles) from Russian control in September - its most significant territorial gains since the war started. The cities of Izyum and Kupiansk, which Ukraine says were retaken on 10 September, were both key supply hubs for the Russian forces. As such, these represent important strategic gains. There is also a Ukrainian counter-attack around the Kherson region in the south of the country. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) says Ukrainian troops have inflicted a \"major operational defeat\" on Russian forces. Justin Bronk of the Royal United Services Institute said Russian positions in Kharkiv had suffered a \"total collapse\". The Russian withdrawal was, he said, \"certainly the most dramatic reverse that we've seen from the Russians since they retreated from Kyiv in April\". Russia confirmed that its forces retreated from Izyum and Kupiansk. It said this was a strategic withdrawal to \"regroup\". It has also said it will continue to target these areas with military strikes. The Russian army appears to have abandoned large quantities of equipment and ammunition during the withdrawal. Russia still holds about 20% of Ukraine, according to the ISW. The areas are largely in the eastern Donbas region and in the south of mainland Ukraine, as well as . the Crimea peninsula which Russia annexed in 2014. .  . The Donbas is a mainly Russian-speaking area, and after Russia seized Crimea in 2014, . pro-Russian forces captured more than a third of the region. . It created two so-called people's republics there. Areas in the west of the country, including Lviv, have experienced missile attacks, but no attempt by Russian forces to take and occupy ground. Russia refuses to recognise its invasion as a war, and says it is undertaking a \"special military operation\" in Ukraine. The Kremlin said its operations would continue \"until all the tasks originally set\" had been achieved. When launching the invasion in February, President Vladimir Putin said his goal was to \". demilitarise Ukraine. \". One objective was to ensure Ukraine didn't join the Western defensive alliance, Nato. . Russia's initial aim was to overrun Ukraine and depose its government. However, it now appears to have limited its ambitions to securing land in Ukraine's east and south. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said his main goal is to drive all Russian troops out, to \"de-occupy our whole territory\". Mr Zelensky has appealed for more funding and equipment to retain the areas retaken from Russia. Western shipments of weaponry are being used heavily by Ukrainian forces. Both sides have suffered losses, although neither publish exact numbers.

{"a": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered a partial mobilisation to reinforce his troops in Ukraine after major combat setbacks this month. In an address to the nation, he said Russia was directly threatened with \"disintegration\" by the Western powers backing the Kyiv government. He also warned Nato that nuclear-armed Russia could use any weapons in its armoury against what he called Western \"nuclear blackmail\". His message came a day after Russian-installed leaders in four regions of eastern and southern Ukraine announced plans for so-called referendums - starting this week - on joining Russia. Crimea was annexed by Russia after just such a move in 2014. Russia plans to call up about 300,000 reservists - that is, people who have had military training and, Vladimir Putin stressed, have specialist skills needed in the Ukraine conflict. They will include many reserve officers, including some over 60, pulled in from retirement. Russia could in theory mobilise some 25 million people for military service, but that is not yet being considered. Both President Putin and Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu stressed that conscripts would not be sent to fight in Ukraine. Mr Shoigu said the extra troops were required to defend a front line stretching for some 1,000km (600 miles). The mobilisation will be spread over months - and Mr Putin has said previously that Russia is prepared for a long fight. Reuters news agency says it is Russia's first mobilisation since World War Two, but the Kremlin did send thousands of conscripts to fight in Afghanistan in the 1980s, and later in Chechnya, in the North Caucasus. . Many poorly-trained conscripts were killed in those costly wars, and this time the Kremlin appears anxious to avoid fuelling anti-war sentiment. Russia's military is numerically superior to Ukraine's, but Ukraine's battlefield tactics and precision Western weapons have narrowed that gap. . Russia's initial invasion force in February numbered about 190,000 troops, in addition to thousands of pro-Russian fighters in the Donbas region. . The Kremlin launched a massive recruitment drive, offering big financial incentives. So extra troops were drafted in, especially from poor regions of Siberia and the Caucasus, including experienced Chechen fighters. . Russia has a normal limit of just over a million military personnel and almost 900,000 civilian staff - but last month President Putin signed a decree to recruit 137,000 more. Currently Russian men aged 18-27 are obliged to do military service, usually for one year, but there are many exemptions on medical grounds or for students. Russia initially denied sending conscript soldiers to Ukraine, but several officers were disciplined after cases came to light of conscripts being forced to sign contracts. President Putin then insisted no conscripts would be sent into combat. Before the invasion Ukraine's military numbers were much smaller - about 196,600 active troops. But Kyiv ordered a mass mobilisation, which has boosted those numbers. . Ukraine's big counter-offensive in the northern Kharkiv region has put the Kremlin on the back foot, Western analysts and politicians say - which explains Vladimir Putin's latest move. Defence Minister Shoigu gave a new death toll on Wednesday - 5,937 Russian troops killed. But that is still far below the estimate of 25,000 dead given by the UK defence ministry in June, while Ukraine claims the figure is about 50,000. . It has emerged that Russia is . recruiting prisoners to fight. , as it struggles with its heavy losses. In the 1979-1989 war in Afghanistan the Soviet military lost about 15,000 troops. BBC Russian has established that Russia's losses in Ukraine include more than 1,000 elite officers, including many pilots, intelligence experts and special forces. President Putin castigated Kyiv's Western supporters for making anti-Russian \"threats\" - and warned that any threat to Russia's territorial integrity would be met with whatever weapons the Kremlin deemed necessary. \"Our country also has various weapons of mass destruction and, in some categories, more modern ones than those possessed by Nato countries,\" he said. \"This is no bluff,\" he added. Russia's military doctrine allows the use of tactical nuclear weapons if the Russian state is threatened with destruction. Russia has already used . long-range hypersonic missiles.  in Ukraine, which can fly faster than 6,000 km/h (3,730 mph). But analysts say that has not been a game-changer. If Russia claims, after controversial referendums, that more parts of Ukraine have joined Russia it may then also claim that Russia itself is under Nato attack. . Kyiv and Western leaders see the \"referendums\" as disguise for a Russian land grab. US Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink said \"sham referenda\" and mobilisation were signs of Russian weakness. . Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte called Mr Putin's military move \"a sign of panic\". . \"His rhetoric on nuclear weapons is something we have heard many times before,\" he said, adding that it left him untroubled. Other Western politicians have also played down any threat of nuclear escalation."},

{"a": "Ukrainians have reported armed soldiers going door-to-door in occupied parts of the country to collect votes for self-styled \"referendums\" on joining Russia. \"You have to answer verbally and the soldier marks the answer on the sheet and keeps it,\" one woman in Enerhodar told the BBC. In southern Kherson, Russian guardsmen stood with a ballot box in the middle of the city to collect people's votes. The door-to-door voting is for \"security\", Russian . state media says. \"In-person voting will take place exclusively on 27 September,\" Tass reported. \"On the other days, voting will be organised in communities and in a door-to-door manner.\". One woman in Melitopol told the BBC that two local \"collaborators\" arrived with two Russian soldiers at her parents' flat, to give them a ballot to sign. \"My dad put 'no' [to joining Russia],\" the woman said. \"My mum stood nearby, and asked what would happen for putting 'no'. They said, 'Nothing'. . \"Mum is now worried that the Russians will persecute them.\". The woman also said there was one ballot for the entire household, rather than per person. Although the evidence is anecdotal, the presence of armed men conducting the vote contradicts Moscow's insistence that this is a free or fair process. Experts say the self-styled referendums, taking place across five days, will allow Russia to claim - illegally - four occupied or partially-occupied regions of Ukraine as their own. . In other words, a false vote on annexation, seven months into Russia's invasion. . The \"annexation\" would not be recognised internationally, but could lead to Russia claiming that its territory is under attack from Western weapons supplied to Ukraine, which could escalate the war further. US President Joe Biden . described the referendums.  as \"a sham\", saying they were a \"false pretext\" to try to annex parts of Ukraine by force in violation of international law. . \"The United States will never recognise Ukrainian territory as anything other than part of Ukraine,\" he said. . British Foreign Secretary, James Cleverly, said the UK had evidence that Russian officials had already set targets for \"invented voter turnouts and approval rates for these sham referenda\". Mr Cleverly said Russia planned to formalise the annexation of the four regions - Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia - by the end of the month. A source in Kherson told the BBC there was no public effort to encourage voting, apart from an announcement on the Russian news agency that people can vote at a port building, which had been disused for 10 years. . Another woman in Kherson said she saw \"armed militants\" outside the building where the vote seemed to be taking place. She pretended to forget her passport, so she didn't have to vote. The woman said all her friends and family were against the referendum. \"We don't know how our life will be after this referendum,\" she said. \"It is very difficult to understand what they want to do.\". Kyiv says the referendums will change nothing, and its forces will continue to push to liberate all of the territories. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin's recent mobilisation of at least 300,000 extra troops has caused many Russian men of fighting age to flee. . One young Russian man who left St Petersburg for Kazakhstan to avoid the draft told . BBC World Service's Outside Source programme.  that that most of his friends were also on the move. \"Right now, I feel like it's a total collapse. I know only maybe one or two folks that don't think about exile right now,\" he said. He said some, like him, are travelling across the border, whereas others have gone to small Russian villages to hide. . \"The big problem of Russia is that we didn't think about the war in Ukraine in February as we think about it right now,\" he said.

OVD-Info said 724 people were detained across 32 different cities on Saturday. Widespread demonstrations have broken out since President Vladimir Putin announced plans to draft 300,000 men to fight in Ukraine. . Unsanctioned rallies are banned under Russian law. . But Mr Putin's move to draft civilians into the military has sparked large scale protests in urban areas, with more than 1,000 people being detained at demonstrations earlier this week. . In Moscow, news agency AFP reported witnessing one demonstrator shouting \"we are not cannon fodder\" as she was arrested by officers. . And in St Petersburg, Russia's second city, one man told reporters: \"I don't want to go to war for Putin.\". Seventy-year-old Natalya Dubova told AFP that she opposed the war and confessed she was \"afraid for young people\" being ordered to the front. . Some of those arrested on Saturday reported being given their draft papers after being detained. The Kremlin defended the practice earlier this week, saying \"it isn't against the law\". Moscow has also approved harsh new punishments for those accused of dereliction of duty once drafted. . Mr Putin signed fresh decrees on Saturday imposing punishments of up to 10 years imprisonment for any soldier caught surrendering, attempting to desert the military or refusing to fight. . The president also signed orders granting Russian citizenship to any foreign national who signs up to serve a year in the country's military. . The decree, which some observers have suggested displays how severe Moscow's shortage of troops has become, bypasses the usual requirement of five years of residency in the country. . Elsewhere, other young Russians continue to flee mobilisation by seeking to leave the country. . On the border with Georgia, queues of Russian cars stretch back more than 30km (18 miles) and the interior ministry has urged people not to travel. . Local Russian officials have admitted that there's been a significant influx of cars trying to cross - with nearly 2,500 vehicles waiting at one checkpoint. . The admission is a change of tone from Russia, with the Kremlin describing reports of Russians fleeing conscription as \"fake\" on Thursday. . One man the BBC spoke to in Vladikavkaz in North Ossetia, on the Russian side of the border, said he could see car registration numbers from all over Russia. \"Our people don't have the correct information about the situation in Ukraine,\" he said. \"Also, what I can say about people that I've been speaking with\u2026 it's simple, people don't want to go to war.\". Meanwhile, Finland has also seen a sharp increase in the number of Russians seeking to enter the country. . Matti Pitkaniitty, a spokesperson for the country's Border Guard, said the number of Russians arriving had more than doubled since last week. . On Friday, the government announced plans to stop Russian tourists entering the country. . \"The aspiration and purpose is to significantly reduce the number of people coming to Finland from Russia,\" President Sauli Niinist\u00f6 told the state broadcaster. . Several other neighbouring states have already ruled out offering asylum to Russians seeking to avoid the draft. . \"Many Russians who now flee Russia because of mobilisation were fine with killing Ukrainians,\" Latvia's Foreign Minister Edgars Rink\u0113vi\u010ds said. \"They did not protest then. It is not right to consider them as conscientious objectors.\" . On Friday, the Kremlin revealed a host of occupations it said will be exempt from conscription aimed at boosting its war effort in Ukraine. IT workers, bankers and journalists working for state media will escape the \"partial mobilisation\" announced by President Putin on Wednesday. But some have cast doubt on the truth of the Kremlin's claims, and reports have been emerging of Russian men who do not meet the criteria being called up by local recruiting officers. Margarita Simonyan, the editor of the state-run media outlet RT, posted to Twitter a list of elderly and disabled citizens ordered to report for duty. ."},

{"a": "Want to understand Russia?. Think of a giant pendulum that's swinging, ever so slowly, to and fro. It's been happening for centuries here. It swings one way and Russia looks west towards Europe, and the country sees itself as an undeniable part of European civilisation. Other times, the pendulum swings in the opposite direction and Russia looks east. Its rulers slam Western civilisation, Western values and declare that Russia's future lies with Asia. Remind you of someone?. With Vladimir Putin, the Russian pendulum has firmly swung to the east. That's hardly surprising: his decision to invade Ukraine has left Russia a pariah in the West and his country battered by Western sanctions. US President Joe Biden has called Putin a \"murderous dictator\"; UK Prime Minister Liz Truss previously dubbed him \"a desperate rogue operator.\". China's president, however, uses quite different language. \"My dear old friend!\" exclaimed Xi Jinping. The two leaders . met on the sidelines of a regional summit.  in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. For his part, President Putin lauded the \"friendship between China and Russia\" and their \"strategic comprehensive partnership\". The two leaders share a similar world view. Both promote the idea of an alternative world order: a \"multi-polar world\" in which their countries act as a counterweight to the West, in particular to the United States. So, is it a case of Putin and Xi \"best friends forever\"?. Not quite. First, BFF rarely exists in global politics. And second, this is an increasingly unequal relationship. . Mr Putin's invasion of Ukraine, which has not gone according to plan, has weakened Russia. The Kremlin admits that the Russian army has suffered \"significant losses\", while Western sanctions are putting the economy under intense pressure. In the Russia-China relationship, it feels more and more that Russia is the junior partner. In their meeting, Mr Putin conceded that China has \"questions and concerns\" about the situation in Ukraine. It was an unexpected admission, by the Kremlin, that Russia's so-called special military operation is causing some anxiety in Beijing. Having burned bridges with the West and sparked an energy war with Europe, Mr Putin is attempting a pivot east (he's left himself little choice). He's hoping to reorient the Russian economy and find new markets for Russian oil and gas. It's quite a challenge. \"The hope is that this pivot will work and will have credible dividends for Russia. But I don't see this happening,\" believes Sergey Radchenko, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. \"What Russia needs is ultimately in the West: its technology, its markets. \"Russia requires Western technologies to develop oil and gas fields off shore and there's a big question mark about whether Russia will be able to do that without Western support. \"It's very difficult to change the direction of gas flows. The Soviet Union and Russia spent decades building networks of pipelines to Europe and that's where the physical infrastructure is. It's very difficult to reorient Russian energy markets towards Asia.\". The summit Mr Putin and Mr Xi are attending is a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, or SCO. Along with Russia and China, members include four Central Asian states - Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan - as well as India and Pakistan. For President Putin the event is an opportunity to demonstrate that, despite international sanctions and attempts by the West to isolate Russia for the invasion of Ukraine, Moscow still has powerful friends. \"Russia likes to point out that its isolation by the West is only in the West and that the world is very multi-polar,\" notes Prof Radchenko. \"But what's interesting is that the whole balance of power in the SCO and in Central Asia is changing and moving away from Russia. \"Putin is in Samarkand at a time when the Russian leader is in the middle of a war he is losing. . \"Meanwhile, for the first time, countries in Central Asia are pursuing their own policy. This is most noticeable with Kazakhstan, which has been very assertive in its relations with Russia. Kazakhstan hasn't been nearly as supportive as Putin had hoped for since Russia invaded Ukraine. There are interesting shifts in the balance of power.\". As the Kremlin promotes its pivot east, it's worth remembering a key point about Russia. This country - the biggest in the world - spans two continents, Europe and Asia. Instead of letting the pendulum swing, perhaps it makes more sense for Russia to look both ways."},

{"a": "Russia's retreat from Kharkiv, north-eastern Ukraine, has exposed key weaknesses in the supplies and staffing of the nation's armed forces, Russian veterans and military bloggers say. . \"You have no idea how tired I am to say hello to someone in the morning and then have to identify his remains later the same day,\" one Russian officer serving as a marine in Ukraine reportedly confided over the phone to a former colleague back home, who published it on his Telegram channel. . \"Just yesterday two of my sniper groups were destroyed by a tank. Three men died instantly, the fourth one fought for his life for an hour and a half, another one in critical condition was taken to hospital. We have hardly any men left and we are holding a front line dozens of kilometres long.\". While Russian officials and state media are trying to play down the Russian forces' retreat from Kharkiv, individual war reporters, veterans and influential military bloggers are acknowledging numerous challenges within closed messaging channels. . Blogs and Telegram channels are littered with stories of inadequate equipment and personnel, compounded by a rigid operational hierarchy. One Telegram channel, sharing experiences of soldiers in the field in Ukraine shortly after the latest retreat, describes how even deploying a small surveillance drone needs to be approved by a senior officer or a general, considerably slowing down understanding of enemy positions. Another channel on Telegram, reportedly run by a Russian special forces veteran, has posted a photo of a Russian soldier sporting an arm patch embroidered with the words: \"There is no opponent worse than your own commander who is a\u2026\" using an expletive to describe him. . There is no way of knowing where and when the image was shot, but what is significant is that it has been widely shared by both veterans and forces in the field, suggesting it reflects popular opinion among the country's rank and file. . Despite rumours of low morale, Russian war reporters and paramilitary soldiers serving in Ukraine are not suggesting that widespread desertion in the field contributed to the latest rout in eastern Ukraine. They say it is much more likely that units simply obeyed an order to retreat. Some Russian fighters on another channel joke bitterly that the \"special military operation\" - as the Russian government publicly terms it - \"has no goals, it only has a path\".   . There are not only concerns about poor leadership. Basic equipment appears to be in such short supply that it is having to be crowdfunded. Dozens of public social media groups are collecting money for a whole range of kit -  everything from drones to socks and underwear. . One of them, called \"The People's Front\", says it has raised about 1.5bn roubles (\u00a315m, $17m) over the past three months, and has already spent it on uniforms, helmets and flak jackets, as well as first-aid kits, binoculars and thermal imagers. . Despite such fundraising, hundreds of pleas have been posted online from dozens of military units - including pilots of Russia's most modern fighter jets - for specific items, such as fire-proof uniforms, torches and two-way radios. But the issue is not just a lack of equipment, it is a lack of troops. . While there are no signs of imminent compulsory conscription, there has been a push for recruitment - described by the government as an \"informal mobilisation\" - since soon after the country's invasion of Ukraine. The Russian Ministry of Defence started posting adverts on popular job websites in early March, something which was rarely done before the war. On one website there are more than 7,000 military vacancies listed - . for gunners. , mortar crew and other combat-focused roles. None of the adverts mention the \"special military operation\" in Ukraine. . Recruitment flyers have also been posted through doors, and displayed on public transport and outside residential apartment blocks and even psychiatric hospitals. . Drafting centres have also resorted to phoning soldiers who have left or retired to ask them to re-join, some of those contacted told the BBC. One soldier who fought in Chechnya in the 1990s says he and his friends were called three or four times. The man, who asked to remain anonymous, says he finally agreed but later refused to sign the contract, put off by what appeared to be poor conditions. Possibly to make the proposition of serving more attractive, the minimum contract length has been slashed from three years to three months, and the upper age limit for a first contract raised from 40 to 60 years old. . Advertised monthly salaries range from 100,000-450,000 roubles (\u00a31,000-\u00a34,500, $1,139-$5,125) - a tempting proposition, despite the dangers of deployment, for those with poor job prospects in economically deprived areas of the country. . Russia is believed to be sending several of these scratch units to Ukraine every 10 days, following training of just a week or less. . Two separate sources on the front line told the BBC that such units, comprising short-term military contractors and fighters from the Wagner mercenary group - the head of which has been . filmed recruiting in a central Russian prison.  - constitute the bulk of Russia's current frontline force. There are reports that those signing contracts may not all be doing so willingly. Russian human rights activists allege there have been cases of men in Chechnya being pressured into joining up by the authorities.  . Russian independent journalists have reported that up to 500 convicts have also been enlisted. One prisoner, Konstantin Tulinov, was lauded in state media after he was killed during combat in July. Tulinov had served multiple sentences, the latest one for torturing inmates in Russian prisons. Whilst these challenges are being discussed within closed groups, there has been no official acknowledgement of the retreat. . On his private Telegram channel, influential state war reporter Yevgeny Poddubny suggested that the latest rout exposed long-running issues. \"The situation is really hard for our troops. The problems which have been discussed both in the public space and during confidential meetings have become obvious.\". But there is no evidence that this message is making its way to the top. Poddubny and several other war reporters were seen speaking briefly with President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the St Petersburg economic forum in June. . While it is not clear exactly what they managed to explain to the president, lack of supplies remains a key issue for the Russian military. ."},

And people can find out but I didn't want to be the one that spoke about it too much.\". Radio 1 at Reading and Leeds on BBC Sounds. Griff says she juggled her studies and love of music with an exhausting schedule of \"travelling into London, writing songs, coming back, doing essays [and] turning up to school really tired\". Despite realising where her real passion was, she vowed to stick it out at school, and ended up getting three As at A-Level. But she realised education wasn't for her. \"My teacher's like: 'Sarah, we haven't seen your personal statement',\" she says. \"I was like: 'Miss, please - I'm gonna take a gap year'.\". Griff spent about a year putting out music before the pandemic hit - but it didn't stop her finding success. . \"I kept releasing music and didn't know if anyone was listening and then I got a Brit Award, which is crazy,\" she says. Her packed touring schedule with Ed Sheeran will take her through until the end of the year, when she plans to take a break from the stage. \"I'm gonna need to take the time to write more music. So that's kind of like my, my downtime, but I'll still be working on writing,\" she says. \"This gap year has turned into a bit of a long-term job. So I don't think I'm going to uni anytime soon.\" .

{"a": "Vladimir Putin has fired the general charged with managing the Russian military's faltering logistics operations in Ukraine. . Gen Dmitry Bulgakov, a deputy defence minister, was removed from his role on Saturday, the defence ministry said on Telegram. The ministry said the 67-year old was \"released\" to transfer into a new role. He will be replaced by Col Gen Mikhail Mizintsev, who managed Moscow's brutal siege at the port city of Mariupol. Gen Bulgakov has run the military's logistics operations since 2008 and was responsible for keeping Russian troops supplied after their deployment to Syria in 2015. . But observers say he has become side-lined in Moscow in recent months, with many blaming him for the chaotic logistics operations that have dogged Russia's advance and seen their troops left undersupplied. . In recent months, the Kremlin has been forced to approach North Korea and Iran - two of its only remaining allies - for new artillery and drone supplies. . Gen Bulgakov's dismissal comes as footage circulated on social media . showing newly drafted Russian recruits being equipped with rusty assault rifles. . Pro-war figures in Russia have welcomed his dismissal and the appointment of Gen Mizintsev - who was sanctioned by the UK for his role commanding the Mariupol siege - will likely be welcomed by hardliners. . Gen Mizintsev, who was dubbed \"the Butcher of Mariupol\" by many Ukrainians, also led Russian forces in Syria and was accused of orchestrating a brutal bombing campaign that levelled the city of Aleppo. . The UK foreign office said he had used \"reprehensible tactics\" and committed \"atrocities\" in both the Ukrainian and Syrian conflicts when announcing sanctions against the 60-year old in March.  . Mr Putin's personnel changes come amid reports that the Russian leader has taken personal charge of the war effort and has started issuing orders to generals in Ukraine himself. . US officials told CNN that the increasingly \"dysfunctional command structure\" in Moscow had forced Mr Putin to take a more active role in the war. . Last month, UK defence officials suggested that Mr Putin had side-lined his defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, after senior defence officials began to mock the top general's \"ineffectual and out-of-touch leadership\". . Meanwhile, the New York Times reported that Mr Putin had denied his commanders permission to retreat from the southern city of Kherson, where Ukrainian troops are slowly advancing. . Citing US intelligence sources, the paper said that his refusal to consider a pullback had caused a decrease in morale among Russian troops in the city, who are largely cut off from their supply lines and rely on a series of pontoon bridges to be re-equipped. ."},

{"a": "Planned concerts in Poland by Pink Floyd co-founder Roger Waters have been cancelled amid outrage over the musician's stance on the Ukraine war. The concert's promoter, Live Nation Poland, confirmed the cancellation but gave no reason for it. . The controversy was triggered by an open letter Waters wrote to Ukraine's first lady, Olena Zelenska. In it, he said, \"extreme nationalists\" in Ukraine \"have set your country on the path to this disastrous war\". . He accused her husband, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, of failing to fulfil his election campaign promises to bring peace to the Donbas region and and made no mention of Russia's responsibility for the war. In response, Mrs Zelenska wrote on Twitter that it was Russia which invaded Ukraine and was now destroying its cities and killing civilians. \"Roger Waters, you should ask for peace from the president of another country,\" she wrote. Mr Water's open letter led \u0141ukasz Wantuch, a Krakow city councillor, to urge people to boycott the concerts. . City councillors have drafted a resolution to declare Mr Waters persona non grata, due to be voted on at a session on September 28. . \"Taking into account Russia's criminal attack on Ukraine as well as the increasing number of war crimes committed by Russian soldiers that are coming to light, [the councillors] express outrage at the theses and statements made by Mr Roger Waters in connection with Russia's invasion of Ukraine,\" the resolution states. Mr Waters, currently on tour in the US, hit back in another Facebook post entitled \"Hey \u0141ukasz Wantuch, Leave them kids alone\", referencing the lyrics of the classic Pink Floyd song, Another Brick in the Wall. He denied an earlier media report that he or his management had cancelled the concerts themselves and accused Mr Wantuch of the \"draconian censoring\" of his work. Asked whether the cancellation was connected to Mr Waters' comments, a venue spokesman for the Tauron Arena in Krakow told the BBC: \"No comment.\". The Polish government has been a staunch ally of Mr Zelensky. It has sent hundreds of Soviet-era tanks and other armaments to Ukraine and encouraged the European Union to introduce tougher sanctions against Russia. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February, the government decided to open Poland's borders to millions of Ukrainian women and children fleeing the fighting. According to the United Nations' Refugee Agency, UNHCR, close to 1.4 million Ukrainians have registered for temporary protection in neighbouring Poland. . Hundreds of thousands of refugees have been put up by Poles in their own homes. ."},

{"a": "When you read it's \"Time to BeReal!\" on your phone, the expectations are clear. You open the app, take a picture of yourself and whatever's in front of you. . It could be the meal you've just cooked, the TV show you're watching, or your computer screen at work. . But as the app grows in popularity, do we need to be more careful what we post when we're on shift?. Or is zooming in on your friend's work computer just innocent fun?. The app was released in 2020, but started to get much more popular in mid-2022. Some reports say BeReal has had more than . 27 million downloads worldwide. . . If you're not familiar with it, it's a social media platform that notifies all users simultaneously at a random time every day. It gives you just two minutes to stop and take a picture of your surroundings. The idea is that it takes you off-guard, forcing you to be more \"real\" than you might be when curating, for example, an Instagram story. . Once you've posted, you can scroll through all of your friends' posts and see what they're up to. . Most users will admit they've enjoyed zooming in to their friends' screen to see the way they type on email, or what task they're up to. But talk has since turned to whether that's allowed - with people flagging data protection and privacy concerns. It's \"definitely a bad idea\" to take a BeReal of your work screen, says Emma Green, a data protection expert and managing partner at Cyber Data Law Solicitors. She says there are a number of factors to consider. \"Firstly, you will more than likely be breaking data protection laws if there's any personal data on those screens.\". That's any information linked to a person that makes them identifiable. So yes, even getting someone's email address in the shot would technically be a breach of the law. More importantly, Emma stresses that taking any photo of your workplace screen is very likely to be a breach of company rules. \"Probably in your employment contract, there will be a duty of confidentiality as an employee not to disclose confidential information about the company that may well be on those screens and even in the office in the background,\" she says. Even though you can choose who to be friends with on the BeReal app, Emma says once something is posted you can never be sure who will see it. Screenshots could be taken, or phones passed around among friends. . \"Especially if people are zooming in and reading emails, you may well be in breach of contract,\" she says. \"It could lead to disciplinaries, and so you could find yourself in a lot of trouble with your employer.\". You might be thinking this advice is dramatic, and be tempted to snap that photo next time your BeReal alert goes off. But Emma's key advice is that the post isn't worth the hassle it might cause. . Even if it's meant to be an innocent picture, shared among friends, if it ends up further than that you could be in trouble. . \"'I wasn't aware' or 'I didn't realise' is not a defence, unfortunately,\" Emma says.

{"a": "TikTok has revealed its breakout artist of the summer - an 18-year-old rapper who says comedy was key to his success. How do you create a viral song on TikTok? Well, the person to ask would be 18-year-old rapper Stepz. The Londoner created one of the sounds of the summer with his second single . Cramp Dat,.  which samples Soulja Boy's 2007 hit Crank That. TikTok says the track dominated their weekly hot tracks chart, taking the number one spot for seven weeks. . And like most things on the platform, it's inspired thousands of people to take on a dance challenge - inspired by the song's lyric \"I got a cramp\". . \"I can't lie, Cramp Dat was just to get some more exposure out there,\" Stepz tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. . \"Cramp Dat is not even my favourite song out of my own. It was more a thing where I know that people will want to dance.\". Stepz's music might be racking up thousands of listens, but his relatable TikToks - think point of view videos and short comedy sketches - have also earned him more than two million followers on the app. \"I would use my comedy to promote my music as well. So most people think that I was a comedian before music, but the comedy was literally just to get my music more out there,\" he says. . And Stepz is glad he's also famous for his jokes. \"A lot of rappers in the UK are just talking about how many guys they've done this and that to, but I don't have to put an image on myself as if I'm someone that I'm not, because I do comedy,\" he adds. \"And people know that this is who I am. I can really just make music and talk about how I feel.\". He maintains that some negative stereotypes still surround rap.  . \"People think that all people in the UK talk about is stabbing this and stabbing that,\" he says. But people forget that rap is a talent. You don't have to be a bad youth to be able to rap.\". TikTok is influencing what we listen to more and more - but not everyone is a fan. Former Radio 1 Chart Show host Scott Mills recently told fellow DJ Greg James on his Unpopular Opinion slot that artists are making music with TikTok in mind. \"I feel this started around the time of the pandemic and the main culprit was Death Bed (Coffee for Your Head),\" Scott said. \"Then Jason Derulo got in on the act with that awful song Savage Love, and since then there's been hundreds. \"No disrespect to the artists but they're making them for TikTok.\". But according to a TikTok music boss, creating a hit just for the platform is notoriously difficult and people wouldn't succeed if they did that. \"I think if anyone is trying to write a song to be successful on TikTok today will probably fail because you can't make it happen,\" David Mogendorff, Head of UK Artist Partnerships, tells Newsbeat. \"You can't create that moment from nothing. . \"It has to be genuine artistry, genuine music and a genuine connection with the audience.\". The company also announced that . Sunroof.  by Nicky Youre & Dazy was its top UK track this summer. And TikTok says Kate Bush's Running Up That Hill - which felt inescapable after it . was used on the latest Stranger Things soundtrack.  - was also massive on the app, featuring in millions of videos. George Ezra also made his debut in TikTok's summer charts, thanks to videos of him performing Green Green Grass at Glastonbury. Follow Newsbeat on . Instagram. , . Facebook. , . Twitter.  and .

{"a": "British wrestling fans got a rare chance to see their idols perform live over the weekend when WWE crashed into Cardiff. But the company's recent closure of its UK division meant the spectacle was a bittersweet experience for some, who are wondering what the future holds for Britain's budding pro-wrestling superstars. \"And still the undisputed WWE Universal Champion, Roman Reigns.\" . As the result of the main event was declared, WWE's biggest UK show in 30 years ended in heartbreak for Scotland's Drew McIntyre and his British fans in Cardiff on Saturday night. . But there are hopes Clash at the Castle will leave a longer and more meaningful legacy than a title win. . \"It can inspire future generations, just like WWE's last UK stadium show in 1992 inspired me,\" McIntyre tells me Radio 1 Newsbeat. . Yet it comes at an uncertain time for the British wrestling scene. Weeks before arriving in Wales, . WWE announced it would be ending its British division NXT UK.  and relaunching it as NXT Europe next year. . Many of the biggest British stars were released from their contracts, including Cardiff's Mark Andrews, who describes the timing as \"weird\".  . \"It does sting that it [was] two weeks before the only stadium show in Wales to ever happen\", Andrews said on his . BBC Radio Wales podcast. . . \"This was a huge opportunity for Wales, for Welsh wrestling and for all the years that we've put the graft in.\"  . \"It would have been lush if one of us could have had the moment to be celebrated. Being released, I can take\u2026 [but] this is something that might never happen again. . \"That's the bit that hurts.\". At the New Wave Wrestling Academy in Newport, where Andrews is idolised, young trainee wrestlers are staying positive about their prospects. . \"NXT UK closing is a sour point,\" says 23-year-old Curtis, from Swansea, who goes by the name Curt Atlas. . \"But it also opens up the scene for people like ourselves, coming out of places like New Wave, to capitalise on the next stage of professional wrestling and make the British scene something even better than it already was,\" he says. Fellow trainee Ali, who's 26 and wrestles as Aluna Blue, is similarly optimistic about the opportunities ahead, with former NXT UK performers now free to wrestle elsewhere.  . \"We're very lucky now that we've got these incredible former WWE superstars around us on the scene,\" she says. . \"We're only going to get better by wrestling them, we can learn so much.\". NXT UK has been divisive since it was launched in 2018, following a rise in the popularity of independent British promotions such as PROGRESS Wrestling and Revolution Pro. . Many of the domestic wrestling scene's biggest names were signed by WWE, which then limited their appearances for other UK companies. . \"NXT UK's influence has been good in some respects,\" says New Wave's owner and head coach Brendan 'Bronco' White. . He highlights the way WWE ensured there were \"medics at shows\" as an example. . However, \"the independent shows the wrestlers were on previously were probably hurt a little bit, because in a lot of cases, I don't think the shoes were filled,\" he says. \"NXT UK closing is bringing all those guys back on the scene, and I feel like that's going to bridge the gap between the great wrestlers and the good wrestlers. It's exciting and I think we will be on the rise again soon.\"   . \"Not everyone wants to get to WWE,\" adds Bronco, who says \"there's money to be made on the independent scene\".  . British wrestling is also recovering from two separate crises that started in 2020, leading to politicians getting involved. . \"The All-Party Parliamentary Group on Wrestling came together in 2020 as a group of MPs who love wrestling,\" the group's co-chair Alex Davies Jones MP tells Newsbeat.  . \"We were incredibly disheartened and shocked at the current state of British wrestling at that time,\" she says. \"It had been through its own '#MeToo' movement called '#SpeakingOut', where . wrestlers spoke out about the horrendous abuse that they were suffering.  from within the industry.\" . \"British wrestling was also struggling with Covid,\" Ms Davies Jones adds, \"with not being able to put on live shows, and [companies] weren't getting any support from the government because wrestling falls in that really difficult in-between scene of not being sport and not being an art form.\" . This led to the group . publishing a report last year. , aimed at improving safeguarding, safety and financial sustainability within the industry. . Seventeen months on, the Labour MP for Pontypridd is optimistic about British wrestling's future, and the legacy WWE's Clash at the Castle will leave. . \"I'm hoping that this event will inspire new fans seeking out their own independent wrestling schools, wrestling promotions, and also encouraging people to give it a go,\" she says. \"Whether you become a fan or whether you decide that you want to give it a go, wrestling is for everybody and I cannot wait to see the impact that this has.\" . This is echoed by Drew McIntyre, who says there is \"absolutely\" still a pathway for young British talent to follow in his footsteps, despite the closure of NXT UK. . \"There was no pathway when I did it,\" he says. . \"I had to forge my own path and it's so much more accessible now.\" . So what advice would he offer the new generations he hopes to have inspired in Cardiff? . \"Believe in yourself, put the work in, find a reputable wrestling school that has produced quality students.\" . \"The trick is, when everybody tells you, 'you're insane, that's not possible, that's an American thing', just nod and smile.\" .

{"a": "US rapper PnB Rock has been shot dead in an apparent robbery at a Los Angeles restaurant. . The musician, 30, was with his girlfriend when a gunman reportedly demanded jewellery before opening fire inside a waffle house in the south of the city. Police found PnB with multiple gunshot wounds and he was pronounced dead in hospital 45 minutes later. No arrests have yet been made over Monday's shooting. Los Angeles Police Department Capt Kelly Muniz said a suspect approached a couple inside Roscoe's House of Chicken and Waffles and demanded they hand over personal items. . She told reporters at the scene this led to \"some sort of verbal exchange\" before the victim was shot several times and fell to the floor. The suspect then \"removed items from the victim\", she said, before running to a waiting getaway car and fleeing the scene. US media has said law enforcement sources confirmed the rapper was the target of the attack. Tributes have since flooded in for PnB Rock - real name Rakim Hasheem Allen - who rose to fame with the release of his 2016 hit Selfish and had collaborated with artists including Ed Sheeran. Superstar Drake posted a photo of the pair together on his Instagram story, and rapper Offset posted a Twitter tribute urging followers to pray for PnB's two children. Others pointed out that the shooting follows the death of fellow rapper Pop Smoke - who was . killed in a Hollywood Hills burglary last February. . It's been suggested his killers were able to find his address after he accidentally revealed it in a social media post. The latest shooting has led to discussions about the safety of rappers, after it was suggested an Instagram photo of PnB and his partner may have revealed the pair's location. . DJ Akademiks, who runs a popular hip-hop YouTube channel, said he had interviewed the rapper just a week ago about a previous attempt to rob him. Nicki Minaj said Pop Smoke's death had taught rappers to be more cautious about their whereabouts. Meanwhile Cardi B took a different view, and challenged people who had blamed PnB Rock's girlfriend Stephanie Sibounheuang for posting the photo. She tweeted that it was \"highly unlikely\" that the suspects had tracked them online and that it was \"irresponsible and inconsiderate\" to blame Stephanie for \"something so tragic\". PnB Rock was born in Philadelphia in 1991, going on to record two studio albums, Catch These Vibes and Trapstar Turnt PopStar. He released his most recent song, Luv Me Again, just two days before the shooting. Follow Newsbeat on . Instagram. , . Facebook. , . Twitter.  and . YouTube. .

{"a": "One day you're the prime minister. The next day, you're not. . And that moment has arrived for Boris Johnson, who has made his . last speech.  as PM and departed 10 Downing Street for the final time. Liz Truss will be taking over and addressing the nation later outside the famous front door. . It can all change so quickly, but what happens when life suddenly stops as PM?. After his final speech, Boris Johnson is headed to Balmoral. To make his exit official, he still has to officially resign by meeting the Queen. Normally, this would take place at Buckingham Palace, but Her Majesty has suffered from mobility issues and it is understood the change was made to prevent the need for any last-minute rearrangements. If he's lucky, he will be given a personal gift by the Queen. Former PM Gordon Brown and his family got a signed photograph. What might Boris Johnson do immediately after that? He could look to a few former prime ministers for inspiration. . We know sleeping is an option - Gordon Brown revealed on David Tennant's podcast that \"you're very tired so you sleep for a bit\". Or he could choose to follow his passions - like former Prime Minister John Major did on the day he left office. . He . said.  it was \"time for lunch and some cricket\" as he headed to the Oval to watch Surrey. . Boris Johnson - who's displayed a fondness for tennis - could jet off to America to watch the US Open. Imagine losing your job AND your house on the same day. \"It's pretty dramatic,\" says Gordon Brown. \"In Britain, when you go, you not only lose the title, but you lose the house overnight and any ability to present yourself as something.\" . Boris Johnson will have spent just over three years living in Downing Street, welcoming the biggest politicians in the world, such as Donald Trump and Justin Trudeau. He's also had access to Chequers - a luxury country estate where a prime minister usually goes to chill out.  . These places will no longer be there for him to use, but house-hunting might not be an issue. He's thought to own several homes that he could be seeing more of soon. We all see the police officers who follow the prime minister around and provide security. But what happens after you give up the top job?. Previous prime ministers continue to receive security, so it's likely it will be the same with Boris Johnson. But that isn't always a good thing. Former Home Secretary . Lord Douglas Hurd.  says your security \"expects to know what you're going to be doing all of the time\".  . And let's not forget that, as prime minister, there is a big support system of secretaries, clerks and IT specialists who take care of everything when you are in the top job. However, they will be staying in Downing Street with the new PM - whoever that turns out to be. . That means Boris Johnson might just have to go back to doing everyday tasks such as calling people and writing letters himself. . Although if he stays on as an MP he will still have assistants to support him. You might remember that the prime minister has a nice official chauffeur-driven government car to take them around the country. . As all former prime ministers are also . entitled to one. , you'll probably continue to see Boris Johnson being driven around in a large Jaguar.  . But what about travelling around the world? . There's a massive RAF plane that takes the prime minister abroad to conduct important business, such as talks on the Russia-Ukraine war. . Unfortunately, he won't be able to continue using it so will have to take commercial flights like the rest of us or charter a private jet. Boris Johnson could continue serving as an MP, which is what Theresa May did, bringing him a salary of \u00a384,144 per year. . He could also write a book, something predecessors Tony Blair and Gordon Brown have done. Or, he might choose to leave politics all together and spend his time riding Boris bikes.

Now her time on the show is over, she wants to use her on-screen fame to make a real-life impact for other deaf people. . \"I never had anyone to look up to that's like me on websites or TV,\" says Tasha - who finished fourth in the ITV competition this summer. Before the villa, the 24-year-old modelled - for websites such as ASOS - with her cochlear implant visible, yet she was a rare example. But according to Tasha, the depiction of the deaf community on TV is \"moving in a very positive direction\". \"I think representation is really coming a long way from where it was a couple of years ago,\" she tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. \"For example, Rose [Ayling-Ellis] on Strictly, and then I'm on Love Island,\" she says. Eastenders actress Rose, Strictly Come Dancing's first deaf contestant, won the show last year. . \"That's a massive thing for the deaf community, and in terms of representation, [it] doesn't happen enough in my opinion,\" says Tasha. But away from the screen, Tasha says there is still work to do - something she wants to help to address. \"A lot of people never know how to approach people that are deaf or hearing impaired because they don't know how to communicate,\" Tasha tells Newsbeat. . \"[You can be deaf-friendly] by learning basic British Sign Language, because if you just learn basic conversation, that really does go a long way.\". \"Always make sure your lips are based on them, because a lot of deaf [and] hearing-impaired people lip-read. Especially me, I'll always look for you 24/7. Another thing is don't cover your mouth!\". She also encourages others to \"be open and not to be judgmental\". \"Don't say comments like, 'I never knew you were deaf', or 'I couldn't tell because you're quiet'. I find it quite offensive.\". Tasha is encouraging others to learn BSL, and to become more deaf-friendly. . A month since the final, Tasha is still with her Love Island boyfriend, Andrew Le Page. But for fans to understand their latest announcement on social media, they'll have to know BSL, as they talk about their search for a house. . The islander says this is to highlight how deaf people can sometimes feel left out of conversations. . Tasha wears a cochlear implant, a small electronic device that electrically stimulates the nerve for hearing. While Tasha was on Love Island, her dad explained in a social media post how Tasha's cochlear implant can make day-to-day life more difficult. . \"Not many people are educated on how cochlear implants work and the side effects they come with, so it can be very draining for me,\" says Tasha. She says wearing the device can take a physical toll, with the magnet and coil inside the device sometimes giving her bad migraines. \"I'm socially active and I'm constantly having to lip-read. Being in group situations, I'm having to really focus on one person's voice, so I can miss out on many conversations.\". \"Even [on Love Island] when somebody said, 'I've got a text', and read out the message, the amount of times I missed out on what was said,\" she adds. . \"So it can really strain, there were days in the villa where I was absolutely drained and exhausted.\" . But Tasha tells Newsbeat that the response to her time on the show has been better than she expected. . \"It's honestly been so overwhelming, but in the most positive way, seeing all the beautiful messages from so many people in the deaf community. . \"I did not expect it at all.\".

Canadian Police arrested seven people and estimated that thousands of dollars in damage was caused.

In . a statement. , she said \"several hundred people began fighting and destroying property\". Bins and food kiosks were overturned and damaged, she said, and tables, fridges and tents knocked down and thrown. \"Several people climbed various fixtures including a tall lamp-post,\" she said.

{"a": "It was a summer of success for women's football, with England capturing the nation's hearts during the Euros. The Women's Super League season kicks off this evening after last weekend's matches were postponed following the death of the Queen. And recent record viewing figures and attendances have led many to predict a massive growth for the game. Chelsea women's boss Emma Hayes agrees, and says the Lionesses' success generated a lot of emotion. \"I just felt excited for all the little kids in the audience looking around seeing their faces,\" she says. And the tournament also brought relief for Emma. \"There was just a huge weight lifted off my shoulders,\" she says. \"I no longer have to bang on all the time about the women's game, because it's actually going to sell itself now.\". But speaking to Radio 1 Newsbeat just before the domestic WSL season starts, Emma accepts there is still a long way to go before the game fulfils its potential. \"Only in the last 12 months have we been able to schedule fixtures with any consistency and have broadcasting slots,\" she says. Clubs are enjoying record ticket sales as the WSL prepares to kick off, with more and more sides playing at least some matches at main stadiums used by their male counterparts. Arsenal are set to break their attendance record after shifting 40,000 tickets for their north London derby later this month. For the opening games this weekend, the season kicks off tonight at a sold-out Meadow Park where more than 2,700 fans will attend Arsenal's home game against Brighton. The fixtures also include Aston Villa and Leicester playing at the grounds used by their men's teams - Villa Park and the King Power Stadium - on Sunday afternoon. It will \"be fantastic\" to have sell-out games, Emma says, but it's not just about one-offs. \"It's about how many of those [will] be returning fans again and again.\". Emma feels there will be highs and lows throughout the season, but the \"peaks will be bigger than last year's and the lows will still be higher\". She believes more change is need for the women's game to progress further, as many clubs are still \"under-resourced\". Investing in their infrastructure and \"levelling up across the game is going to take a period of time\", she says. \"I've always been an advocate of leaving the FA and into a separate entity, because I believe we could take the expertise from somewhere like the Premier League to help clubs build on their models. . \"It will happen, it's just when.\". While Emma's passion is to grow the women's game more widely, in her day job she's been at the top for 10 years, winning multiple trophies. As a manager who has achieved so much, Emma says she'll look back at all of her success \"with a little more fondness as I age\". She describes lifting trophies as \"fabulous but such a relief\". \"The highs and lows within that winning, believe it or not, isn't as memorable to me, because it's the journey that I think most coaches enjoy anyway.\". The secret to lasting 10 years in the job is \"multifaceted\" but Emma says her strength is the ability to \"evolve really well\". \"I'm not someone who gets stuck. I accept change, embrace change, and try and move with it. \"I'll switch off. I know that I need that for my own mental health. I don't stress too much.\". And what does she see in her future?. To start with, \"winning at the weekend\" in the opening game and more titles this year. \"Staying healthy, being the best mum, paying the bills because there is real-life stuff,\" she says. \"And we have to keep growing the game in the best way I possibly can.\".

{"a": "Saraya-Jade Bevis, aka WWE's Paige, has shocked fans by making her debut for a rival. The British-born wrestler walked out to a standing ovation at Arthur Ashe Stadium in New York on Wednesday. All Elite Wrestling (AEW), which staged the Dynamite: Grand Slam event, officially welcomed her after the surprise appearance. Saraya announced she was leaving WWE in June after a long absence from the ring due to a neck injury. Her first appearance for AEW came after a four-way Women's World Championship match between Toni Storm, Dr. Britt Baker, DMD, Athena and Serena Deeb. Saraya, wearing a hot pink, studded leather jacket, emerged at the top of the walk-on ramp as a chorus of cheers rang out. After making her way into the ring, she pointed to the mat and yelled \"my house\" while glaring at the other wrestlers. It's not clear if Saraya, who last wrestled for the WWE in 2018, will perform in any AEW matches. But a tweet from company boss Tony Khan confirmed she had been added to its roster of stars. The reveal seems to have blindsided most fans, with one calling it a \"legit shock\", and many praising AEW for the \"huge signing\". Saraya, who was born in Norwich, is one of professional wrestling's best-known female talent. The 30-year-old held a number of major WWE titles during her career, and received awards recognising her contribution to its women's division. Saraya was played by Florence Pugh in Fighting With my Family, a 2019 film based on Saraya's early career and journey into the WWE. She is due to return to the UK when she makes an appearance in Norwich on 15 October. Follow Newsbeat on . Instagram. , . Facebook. , . Twitter.  and . YouTube. .

{"a": "TikTok has just launched a feature promising \"a whole new creative experience\" - but people have been quick to question how new it really is. The addition, called TikTok Now, asks users to take a photo or video from their phone's front and back cameras at a random time of day. In a . blog post. , the company says this will allow users to \"share their most authentic moments\". But many have pointed out that it looks pretty similar to BeReal. That app, seen as an alternative to the filtered and curated feeds often associated with social media, has grown rapidly since it was launched by a small French company. It's currently third in Apple's overall UK App Store downloads chart, compared with TikTok's 13th place. But it has got some catching up to do, with some reports putting its total downloads at about 27 million against . TikTok's estimated three billion. . There are some subtle differences between TikTok's offering and BeReal's. Both will send users a notification at a random time of day, after which they'll have a limited time to snap a photo. TikTok Now also allows for 10-second videos. BeReal prompts you with the message \"It's time to BeReal\", whereas TikTok has settled on \"It's Time to Now\" for its daily countdown launch. As for sharing your posts, BeReal is restricted by design - photos are only meant to be seen by a small circle of close friends, in line with the app's low-key attitude. TikTok Now will offer users the ability to share their posts with the wider world, although it will be limited to friends by default. And younger users will have automatic restrictions placed on their posts. Following TikTok's announcement people were quick to point out that the concept behind TikTok Now looked very familiar. Others were more direct, accusing it of \"blatantly copying\" its smaller competitor. Tech experts leapt on the fact that Instagram had been beaten to the launch, after . the company confirmed last month.  that it was testing Candid Challenges, its own BeReal-style feature. And industry analyst Matt Navarra said the announcement by ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, was \"shameless and ferociously fast\". Could my BeReal get me sacked?. Instagram U-turns on TikTok-style revamp. TikTok reveals 2022 summer breakout artist. Social media companies have a track record of \"borrowing\" ideas from each other - with varying degrees of success. Some features we take for granted - Twitter's \"Like\" button, Instagram's Stories and the trend for short, vertical videos - have either inspired imitators or been copied from elsewhere. For example, Instagram recently rolled back an unpopular . TikTok-style revamp.  that filled people's feeds with videos. Even celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner weighed in, accusing the app of trying to imitate its rival and urging it to \"make Instagram Instagram again\". And you might remember Fleets - Twitter's ill-fated attempt to introduce disappearing tweets similar to Instagram's Stories features. Or you might not. . After a backlash. , the company quietly retired the feature after just a few months, saying it hadn't \"seen an increase in the number of new people joining the conversation with Fleets like we hoped\". As for TikTok Now, users in the USA will get it first, with the button for the feature replacing the current Friends tab. There are plans to release it as a separate app in some countries. It remains to be seen whether it will stick around long-term or vanish more quickly than a Vine video. Follow Newsbeat on . Instagram. , . Facebook. , . Twitter.  and . YouTube. .

TS is a condition that \"causes a person to make involuntary sounds and movements called tics\", . according to the NHS. . \"I have Tourette's, I've always had it, apparently,\" the Scottish singer said. He recently mentioned on stage that he has the condition, explaining why his shoulders sometimes twitch. . \"I do the shoulder twitch quite a lot. And you see underneath every TikTok and stuff, people are like, 'why is he twitching?', which is fine. Curiosity is fine.\". \"Do you think before performing [in front of] 20,000 people, as an anxious person, I'm going to take a big line of cocaine? Never going to happen.\" . Sources: . NHS . and . Tourette's Action. There has been a positive reaction to Lewis's honesty from fans with the condition. . \"It's good that someone of that calibre is able to feel comfortable enough to say, 'Yeah, I've got Tourette's syndrome',\" Holly Ann Maria tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. \"I think it's really important because it shows that yes, he has a debilitating disability. However, he is still very talented.\". The 23-year-old from Essex says Lewis's attitude is \"really quite refreshing\". \"A lot of people don't like to talk about controversial topics, but he literally talks about anything and everything and doesn't care.\". Lewis also spoke about how he has had Botox in his shoulder to try to limit the tics. . \"It's a new thing, I haven't really learned much about it - I'm learning. I had Botox on my shoulder to stop it moving. It worked for a bit.\". He told fans that he didn't think it was a big deal, but that when he got the diagnosis, it made sense to him. .

Once upon a time, it might have been surprising to see the West African genre's breakout star chatting to British pop royalty. But Eddie, who's been hosting the UK's first Official Afrobeats Chart Show for the past 12 months, isn't so shocked. \"It's a year that's been really significant for Afrobeats,\" he says. \"The growth, the sound that's penetrated around the world.\". The genre - a mix of African and Western influences - has seen a massive rise in popularity over recent years, with songs regularly crossing over into the mainstream. Burna Boy and Wizkid, two of Nigeria's biggest stars, have headlined some of the world's major music festivals and both took home Grammys in 2021. And some of the premier names in music, like Beyonce and Drake, have also featured Afrobeats artists on their albums. Burna Boy, who has dominated the Afrobeats chart since it launched, has been its poster child. His recent hit Last Last spent a whopping 13 consecutive weeks at number one - the longest time permitted before a track is retired from the top spot. He's also worked with top names including Ed Sheeran, Stormzy, Jorja Smith and rapper Dave. \"Everyone has seen Burna's rise transcend the west African Nigerian sound into the UK sound,\" says Eddie. \"And more importantly he's been able to just go around the world waving the flag of Afrobeats.\" . Last Last is among 11 tracks to have crossed over into the UK's Official Singles Chart Top 100 and Top 40, both peaking in the top 5. It was pipped to the overall top slot by Fireboy DML's Peru featuring Ed Sheeran, the best-performing track based on streams and sales in the UK. \"Whether it's new or established artists breaking new barriers around the world, selling out venues, stadiums, collaborating with other artists, it's just been beautiful to see the growth,\" says Eddie. \"Especially here in the UK where we have at least four Afrobeats songs in the official charts as well.\". Eddie is preparing to celebrate the Official Afrobeats Chart Show's one-year anniversary later on BBC Radio 1Xtra. And he's hoping year two is going to be even more exciting. \"For me the collaborations are going to get crazier and crazier,\" says Eddie, thinking back to Burna Boy's chat with Elton John. \"Wouldn't we want to see that sort of collaboration as well?. \"I see it getting wider and wider and a new generation taking on to it. \"I've always felt the music was going to get here - it's been about people having the privilege of being able to catch up with this music.\".

{"a": "Justin Bieber says he is taking another break from touring to \"make my health a priority\". In June, . the singer revealed.  he was suffering from facial paralysis, after a diagnosis of Ramsay Hunt syndrome. The 28-year-old, who has been on his Justice world tour, now says recent shows have \"taken a real toll\" and he needs more time to \"rest and get better\". It comes a month after the singer announced his return to the stage. Posting on . his Instagram. , he says he had given \"everything I have\" following a recent show in Brazil. Ramsay Hunt syndrome.  is when a shingles outbreak affects the facial nerve near someone's ears, resulting in paralysis of parts of the face. \"After getting offstage, the exhaustion overtook me and I realised I need to make my health the priority right now,\" he says. \"So I'm going to take a break from touring right now. I'm going to be OK, but I need to take time to rest and get better.\". Ramsay Hunt Syndrome cannot be passed from one person to another, but it is a complication from a transmissible disease called shingles. Shingles is linked to the chickenpox virus that many people can get when they're children. According to the charity Facial Palsy UK, if the immune system becomes depressed and is less able to fight off infection, the body can become vulnerable to a reactivation of the chickenpox virus. It says stress is often a trigger as it can weaken the immune system, and people who are stressed are more likely to suffer from infections. Justin had earlier told fans he had been doing facial exercises to regain movement, but that it would still take time to recover. Back in June, the Canadian . posted a video.  describing how the condition has impacted him. \"It is from this virus that attacks the nerve in my ear and my facial nerves, and has caused my face to have paralysis,\" he said in the three-minute video. . He also smiled and blinked, showing his followers how the right side of his face did not move. Nicoya Rescorla, who has the same condition as Justin, told Newsbeat in June that it had \"taken away my independence\". . \"The pain has been horrendous - it's been debilitating,\" . she said. . The 28-year-old, from Marazion in Cornwall, got Ramsay Hunt in October 2020, and says it started with neck pain before the paralysis kicked in. Following that, she experienced a range of other symptoms too. \"The vertigo and balance has really knocked me sideways,\" she adds. \"It's isolated me really physically and mentally because I can't just go out if I want to - I'm having to rely on my husband and my mum,\" Nicoya said. But she believes Justin speaking out about the condition is important. . \"It's powerful for people like me and other people who are going through Ramsay Hunt syndrome.\". Follow Newsbeat on .

Afolabi spoke to BBC Newsbeat about his own reaction.  \"I still struggle to call myself a black Brit. I grew up here all my life and I have strong ties here, but I'm also Nigerian\" says Afolabi. \"There are times when this country will remind you that we're not wanted and it makes me glad that I'm Nigerian because I have a community that I can still relate to,\" says the 29-year-old. \"However, Stormzy's video really made me proud to call myself a black Brit.\". Afolabi was particularly excited to see all the stars in the video - from talk show hosts to . football managers. . \"Take Ian Wright as an example,\" he says. . \"He's a legend that faced adversity and got into professional football at a late age and still succeeded.\".
