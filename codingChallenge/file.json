The 20-year-old, who plays Lucas Sinclair, was asked how he dealt with being one of the few black cast members in the Netflix hit. He said his treatment from some fans \"took a toll\" on him. \"My very first Comic-Con, some people didn't stand in my line because I was black,\" he told fans at a convention in Belgium. Caleb, who joined Stranger Things at age 14, is one of five original main characters alongside co-stars Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo, Noah Schnapp and Millie Bobby Brown. . The other actors have more Instagram followers than Caleb - something that he discussed with fans during his on-stage appearance at Heroes Comic Con in Brussels. In a video . shared on Twitter.  by an attendee, he says he asked his parents why he was the \"least favourite\" even though he was \"on the same show as everybody\". \"My parents had to be like 'It's a sad truth, but it's because you're the black child on the show'. \"Because I was born with this beautiful chocolate skin, I'm not loved.\" . Caleb said people had avoided him at early meet-and-greet events, telling him it was \"because you were mean to Eleven\", referring to Lucas's hostility towards Millie Bobby Brown's character in season one. \"Even now some people don't follow me or don't support me because I'm black,\" he told fans in Belgium. \"Sometimes overseas you feel the racism, you feel the bigotry. \"Sometimes it's hard to talk about and for people to understand, but when I was younger it definitely affected me a lot.\". For Stranger Things fan Kadie, who is black, it's tough to hear about Caleb's experience. \"I wish it was a surprise, but it was a 'here you go' moment,\" the 21-year-old tells BBC Newsbeat. She says for people in the black community it was \"a repeat moment\" and something quite relatable. \"It makes you sad and angry at one point, but then you shrug it off and it's a repeat, and you feel bad for the actor and you realise that's the reality,\" she says. Kadie feels to improve things, it's important to have more diversity in casting and behind the scenes. She says the problem will still exist, but that more diversity \"will help shift people's views if we put more colour in their face\". Despite being a worldwide hit, Stranger Things . has faced some criticism.  for its lack of casting diversity and accusations of . sidelining its black characters. . Caleb is the latest black star to talk about receiving backlash because of the shows they were a part of. Lord of the Rings actors recently condemned the \"relentless\" racist abuse suffered by cast members of the newly released spin-off series The Rings Of Power. Non-white actors were trolled online for portraying a range of white fictional characters. Speaking at this summer's Comic-Con event in the US, the star of another fantasy drama spin-off, House of the Dragon, hit out at racist trolls who criticised his casting in the new Game of Thrones series. Steve Toussaint, who plays Lord Corlys Velaryon, said it was \"an issue they have to deal with, I don't have to\". And Disney's recently released trailer for a new live-action version of the Little Mermaid, starring black actress Halle Bailey, generated criticism from people upset because the cartoon version featured a white mermaid. . Fellow Disney actor Rachel Zegler came to her defence, saying: \"If you don't support my girl Halle, who is the perfect Ariel, you don't support any of us.\". Despite his experiences, Caleb said he was determined to not be drawn into negativity. \"With my platform I want to spread positivity and love because I do not give hate back to people who give hate to me,\" he said.

Andy Saunders has an obsession. It's Project Apollo, one of the defining events in our species' history. . But he's also got a deep frustration. And that's the pictures that record those remarkable space missions in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Or, rather, it's the way those pictures are presented to us - often less than sharp, flat, and compressed to death. . It's why the Cheshire property developer took a decision a few years back to put his career on hold and dedicate his time fully to reworking the US space agency's (Nasa) image archive. . The result is a gloriously sumptuous new book called Apollo Remastered. Four hundred pictures that detail humanity's first foray to another world. . Some of the scenes you'll recognise; they're among the most iconic photos ever taken. But others you will not have seen before; and certainly not in the detail that Andy has rendered them. They have a crispness and depth that makes you want to reach out and touch something. . This success comes, in part, from using very high-definition scans of the original film material (kept in a deep freeze by Nasa to preserve it), but also from his mastery of modern digital editing and enhancement techniques, one or two he's developed himself along the way. . \"There's no reason why we shouldn't be seeing these important moments in history in anything other than incredible quality, because they used the best cameras, the best lenses, and the best film that was processed in the most advanced photo lab available. It doesn't make any sense,\" Andy says. In his remastered volume, we get to see the only clear, recognisable image of Neil Armstrong's face as he stands on the Moon. (How are there not more pictures of this historic figure on the lunar surface?). There's the first clear imagery of life on board the stricken Apollo 13 mission, the one that had the near-fatal explosion en route from Earth. And we get to zoom in on the golf ball Apollo 14's Alan Shepard said he struck for \"miles and miles\". It barely went 40m. Some of the most impressive work Andy has done is with the 16mm movie sequences that were captured by the astronauts inside their capsules on the journeys to and from the Moon. There are 10 hours of this material in the Apollo archive. Andy uses a \"stacking\" technique in his editing software to layer, align and process multiple frames to synthesise one highly detailed image that looks like it's come from a much better quality stills camera. . A classic example is the view of the \"cue card\", or \"clapperboard\", that Apollo 8 astronaut Bill Anders used in his onboard \"home movies\". Individually, the frames are blurred and \"noisy\". But once those frames have been through Andy's computer, we see features that were previously invisible, such as the individual timing hands on Anders' wristwatch. . Andy's favourite remastered image is probably the one that adorns the front cover of his book. Of the 35,000 pictures he reviewed in the Apollo archive, it looked to be among the least promising. It was chronically underexposed. . The only thing it had going for it was a small flash of light towards the top that seemed like it could be a reflection in a window. But in the magic of modern digital software, something truly epic emerged: the Apollo 9 commander Jim McDivitt in his bubble helmet about to manually dock two spacecraft high above the Earth.  . \"It's just an absolutely stunning portrait of an Apollo astronaut in 1969, apparently almost looking up in wonder through the window,\" Andy explains. \"In reality, it's even better than that because McDivitt is actually in the process of undertaking the docking, and the stakes were very high. This was the first time we'd had humans in a spacecraft incapable of getting them home, because they were testing the lunar module and it didn't have a heatshield. So, if they didn't make this docking, they couldn't have come back. It's an incredibly precious moment, an intense moment, a historic moment.\". Andy's had to become a student of light and colour. This has involved talking to the astronauts to mine their first-hand impressions. He's also trawled through the hours of mission voice recordings, to pick up any observational details at the time the pictures were taken. He understands the tricks and quirks. \"There are all kinds of things that affect the colour of the film,\" he says. . \"Some magazines have aged more than others; some were processed slightly differently; some were scanned slightly differently; and if the astronaut took a photograph out of the Command Module window - that's got a slightly different colour tone than if the photo was taken through the Lunar Module window.\" . In the coming days, Nasa will attempt to recapture the Apollo spirit. It will initiate its Artemis programme, with a huge new rocket sending a capsule around the Moon. It's an uncrewed test flight that will herald crewed missions later in the decade. . Artemis is sure to be a visual extravaganza. We can expect cameras from all vantage points, 360-degree vistas, 4K definition and live streaming. . Andy says he'll be an enthusiastic spectator, although he doubts all the modern technology will quite match the romance of the old film. \"You know, we're going to see the first woman walk on the Moon, which will be an incredible moment. Hopefully, someone remembers to actually take a photograph.\". Apollo Remastered is published by Penguin/Particular Books on 1 September. A collection of photos will also go on tour, starting at London's Royal Albert Hall at the end of September before moving on to the Glasgow Science Centre in November. Andy discusses the photos on .

The BBC found millions of tonnes of undeclared emissions from gas flaring at oil fields where BP, Eni, ExxonMobil, Chevron and Shell work. Flaring of natural gas is . the \"wasteful\" burning of excess gas released.  during oil production. The companies said their reporting method was standard industry practice. Flared gases emit a potent mix of carbon dioxide, methane and black soot which pollute the air and accelerate global warming. The BBC has also found high levels of potentially cancer-causing chemicals in Iraqi communities near oil fields where there is gas flaring. These fields have some of the highest levels of undeclared flaring in the world, according to our findings. . In response, David Boyd, UN special rapporteur on human rights and the environment, compared these communities to \"modern sacrifice zones, areas where profit and private interests are prioritised over human health, human rights and the environment\". Under Poisoned Skies. The deadly impact of the oil giants' toxic air pollution on children and the planet is revealed in this BBC News Arabic investigation from the front line of climate change in Iraq. The documentary is available . to watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK only).  and is also being broadcast on BBC World News at 08:10 GMT on Saturday 1 October. Companies have long recognised the need to eliminate all but emergency flaring. BP, Eni, ExxonMobil, Chevron and Shell . are committed to a 2015 World Bank pledge.  to declare and end routine flaring by 2030 - . in Shell's case by 2025. But the companies say that where they have contracted with another company to run day-to-day operations, it is that other firm's responsibility to declare flaring emissions. . Such fields are a major part of oil production - . accounting for 50%.  of these five companies' portfolios, on average. However, through months of analysis the BBC found dozens of oil fields where these operators are not declaring the emissions either, meaning no-one is. Using . World Bank flare-tracking satellite data,.  we were able to identify the emissions from each of these sites. We estimate that in 2021, almost 20 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent went unreported from these flares. That is equal to the greenhouse gas emissions 4.4 million cars would produce in a year. In response, all five firms said that the approach to reporting emissions only from the sites they directly operate was standard industry practice. . Shell and Eni additionally said that they do give an overall emissions figure which includes flaring from non-operated sites, but said this is not broken down or included in their World Bank pledge to cut emissions.  . A BBC News Arabic investigation indicates that flaring increases the risk of some cancers for people living near oil fields in Iraq. People living in some of the world's biggest oil fields in Basra, south-east Iraq - Rumaila, West Qurna, Zubair and Nahran Omar - have long suspected that childhood leukaemia is on the increase, and that flaring is behind it. . In the Basra region, new cases of all types of cancer rose by 20% between 2015 and 2018, according to a leaked Iraq Health Ministry report seen by BBC News Arabic. It blames air pollution. . BP and Eni are the lead contractors at Rumaila and Zubair oil fields respectively, but as they are not the operators they do not declare the emissions. Neither do the sites' operators. . BBC News Arabic worked with environment and health experts near the four sites in 2021 to test for cancer-causing chemicals associated with flaring over two weeks.  . The air tests indicated levels of benzene, . linked to leukaemia and other blood disorders. , reached or exceeded Iraq's national limit in at least four places. . Urine samples we collected from 52 children indicated that 70% had elevated levels of 2-Naphthol, a form of the . possibly cancer-causing substance.  naphthalene. . Dr Manuela Orjuela-Grimm, professor of childhood cancer at Columbia University, said: \"The children have strikingly high levels \u2026 this is concerning for [their] health and suggests they should be monitored closely.\" . When she was 11, Fatima Falah Najem was diagnosed with a type of blood and bone cancer called acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Exposure to benzene can increase the risk of people developing this condition. . Fatima lived with her parents and six siblings near Zubair oil field, where Eni is the lead contractor. . Neither Eni nor Zubair's operating company declare flaring emissions there. . For health reasons, Iraqi law prohibits flaring within six miles (10 km) of people's homes. . But the flares in Zubair blaze almost continuously, just 1.6 miles from the family's front door. . Fatima drew the \"fiery flames\" that surrounded her home, during her chemotherapy treatment. . She told us she enjoyed watching them at night, and came to normalise them. But for her father, watching her get sick was \"like being on fire without being able to extinguish it\". Fatima died last November as her family desperately sought a bone marrow transplant. She was 13. . Asked for a response, Eni said it \"strongly rejects any allegation that its own activities are endangering the health of the Iraqi people\". . Eni said that it does not contractually have responsibility for flaring in Zubair. Rumaila oil field, 25 miles away, flares more gas than any other site in the world, according to BBC calculations - enough to power nearly three million UK homes a year. BP is the lead contractor - it helped establish and now supervises the operator, Rumaila Operating Organisation (ROO). Neither declares any flaring from the oil field. . ROO's operating standards, which BP signed, say: \"Those who are impacted by pollution levels that exceed national limits are legally entitled to compensation.\" . But Ali Hussein Julood, a 19-year-old leukaemia survivor, says that he and his father were met with silence when they sought compensation from BP in 2020 and 2021. BP said: \"We are extremely concerned by the issues raised by the BBC - we will immediately review those concerns.\" . On the leaked report on cancer in the Basra area, Iraq's Oil Minister Ihsan Abdul Jabbar Ismail told us: \"We instructed all the contracted companies operating in the oil fields to uphold international standards.\" . If all the natural gas flared globally were captured and used it could replace more than nine-tenths of Europe's gas imports from Russia, based on figures . from the International Energy Agency. Capturing the gas can be initially expensive and technically difficult, . according to the World Bank.  It estimates that ending all routine flaring could cost as much as $100bn (\u00a392bn). But Mark Davis, chief executive of Capterio, which advises oil companies on capturing flared gas, told the BBC that countries like Norway have shown it is possible with the help of strong regulation. .

The conference is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. So we asked more than a dozen climate scientists, negotiators and economists from around the world what they wanted to see agreed this week. The scientists all wanted to see more countries commit to net zero by 2050 at the latest. Yet many said changes in the next decade would be the most impactful. Governments must agree to \"cut emissions by half in the next 10 years\", says Prof Mark Maslin, who researches the impact of humans on the environment at University College London. The Paris climate agreement in 2015 committed countries to reach net zero between 2050 and 2100. But reaching net zero is not easy and means big changes to transport, manufacturing, food supplies, construction and almost every aspect of life. . And many of the scientists think 2050 might be too late, particularly if countries don't cut emissions drastically before then. . \"The longer you leave it, the more difficult it is to deliver net zero by 2050,\" says Prof Martin Siegert, who researches changes in glaciers at Imperial College London. . More than 100 countries have made the 2050 commitment, yet dozens have not. Others big emitters, . such as China.  and . Saudi Arabia. , have made a net zero commitment - but by 2060, not 2050. . One of the world's largest emitters, India. , says it will get to net zero by 2070 - 20 years later. The scientists said countries must sign up to go quicker. \"We've got to get international consensus at least in principle around the notion of net zero by 2050,\" says Prof Siegert. \"If that can be done at least in principle at Glasgow, it will be a major step forward.\" . The scientists we spoke to said investment in fossil fuels also had to be stopped, with money instead going into renewables like solar and wind. . Last week at COP, there were announcements on . cuts to coal.  and . methane. , but many scientists say they don't go far enough. . \"There needs to be a blanket stop on any foreign investment that builds and supports coal power plants or any other fossil technology\" says Prof Malte Meinhausen, of the University of Melbourne. And Dr Natalie Jones, a specialist in existential risk at the University of Cambridge, says countries need to publish robust plans and policies on how they will achieve their targets. Having plans on paper, or in law, makes it easier to get countries to stick to their word, she says. \"It provides a kind of hook that you can use to hold countries accountable because you can say, 'well, you've promised this. This is your policy statement'.\" . \"The UK, for example, has this relatively ambitious emissions reduction targets but it's concurrently . trying to open a new oil field.  at the moment,\" she added. \"The science tells us these things are fundamentally incompatible.\"  . One proposal from the scientists was for every country to have a limit on how much it can emit. . However, what the limits for countries might be, and how any scheme might work in practice, is likely to lead to difficult negotiations. Previous attempts to reach an agreement have failed. . An alternate solution, suggested by some we spoke to, was a global carbon tax system where consumers and companies, rather than governments, pay a tax on emissions. . By making business as usual more expensive, they argue, companies will be more likely to invest in cleaner technologies, which is essential to lowering emissions around the world. . \"A carbon tax needs to happen,\" says Danae Kyriakopoulou a senior policy fellow at the London School of Economics. \"We have to create incentives and create change in behaviour.\". There is support for the idea. The head of the World Trade Organization recently called for a coordinated approach to taxes on emissions. However, higher costs could be passed on to consumers who use fossil fuels to drive their cars or heat their homes. . Ms Kyriakopoulou thinks this could be managed by taking the money raised by a tax and redirecting it to reduce costs. A country could subsidise home insulation to keep homes warmer and reduce the cost of bills, for example. . Many people in developing countries, are suffering, says Dr Aditya Bahadur, a researcher at the International Institute for Environment and Development. . \"They need resources to adapt to these changes. They need knowledge and information. They need new kinds of technologies. They need protective infrastructure.\". The developed world had pledged to provide $100bn a year to poorer countries by 2020, but this has slipped to 2023. . The . US is already pledging more money. , but the scientists we spoke to said reaching the commitment as soon as possible was important. Dr Bahadur says a focus on adapting to climate change would allow countries to share technologies and advice on how to cope with extreme weather. . For example, a country that experiences droughts or floods frequently could give advice to others that have just started experiencing extreme weather events. . \"I have a colleague in Bangladesh who says Bangladesh has a lot teach to Germany about how to deal with floods.\". There is optimism for collaboration and knowledge-sharing among those we spoke to. The Covid-19 pandemic was given as an example for how countries can find ways to work together. . \"I am optimistic that a lot of good things will come out of COP26,\" says Dr Nana Ama Browne Klutse, a scientist at the university of Ghana, in Accra. She contributed to . a major UN report on climate change, published this year. .   . \"Everyone wanted to fight this pandemic.

The rocket experienced what appeared to be a propulsion failure about one minute after leaving the launch pad. A motor pushed the capsule clear, enabling it to make a soft return to the ground with the aid of parachutes. New Shepard regularly carries people, but on this occasion the only payload was a batch of zero-G experiments. The incident occurred at an altitude of just over 28,000ft (8.5km) while the vehicles were moving upwards at 700mph (1,120km/h). The system is designed to sense problems in the booster rocket and then push the capsule away to a safe distance. Dr Erika Wagner, a senior director at Mr Bezos's Blue Origin space company, was doing the in-flight webcast commentary. \"It appears that we've experienced an anomaly with today's flight,\" she said shortly after the separation of the capsule from the rocket booster. \"This wasn't planned and we don't have any details yet.\". This was the 23rd mission of New Shepard since its introduction in 2015. In July 2021, on the system's 16th outing, it started carrying people on short hops above the atmosphere. The crew on that occasion included Jeff Bezos himself and his brother, Mark. Flight 18 gained international attention when it carried the Star Trek movie actor William Shatner aloft. Monday's mission was uncrewed. The capsule was carrying 36 payloads from academia, research institutions, and students from across the globe -  largely paid for by the US space agency Nasa. These experiments were aiming to exploit the particular conditions of weightlessness experienced at the top of the capsule's routine apogee of a little over 62 miles (100km). Had people been on board during the abort, they would have experienced a sharp jolt at the moment of separation but should have been none the worse for their experience on landing. The Federal Aviation Administration, which licenses commercial spaceflight in the US, said it would be investigating Monday's incident. . \"Before the New Shepard vehicle can return to flight, the FAA will determine whether any system, process or procedure related to the mishap affected public safety.

The AI Liability Directive would reduce the burden of proof on people suing over incidents involving such items. Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders said it would make a legal framework that was fit for the digital age. Self-driving cars, voice assistants and search engines could all fall under the directive's scope. If passed, the Commission's rules could run alongside the . EU's proposed Artificial Intelligence Act.  - the first law of its kind to set limits on how and when AI systems can be used. Artificial intelligence systems are trained on large amounts of data or information to allow machines to perform tasks which would typically be considered a matter of human intelligence. . The AI Liability Directive, . published by the European Commission on Wednesday,.  will introduce a \"presumption of causality\" for those claiming injuries by AI-enabled products. This means victims will not have to untangle complicated AI systems to prove their case, so long as a causal link to a product's AI performance and the associated harm can be shown. . For a long time, social media firms have hidden behind the caveat that they are merely platforms for other people's stuff and therefore not responsible for the content of it. . The EU does not want to repeat this scenario, with companies which make drones, for example, getting off the hook if they cause harm just because the firm itself wasn't directly behind the controllers. If your product is set up to be able to cause distress or damage, then you need to take responsibility if it does, is the clear message - and perhaps one which is overdue. Is this unduly harsh on a comparatively new industry? If a car crashes because of the mechanics inside the vehicle, that's down to the manufacturer. But the behaviour of the driver is not. Should this draft go through, all eyes will be on the first test case. Europe continues to chase the tail of big tech with big regulation - but is it being realistic here?. According to the European Commission,.  high-risk use of AI can include infrastructure or products which could directly affect someone's life and livelihood, such as transport, exam-scoring and border control. Information disclosure about such products will let victims gain more insights into liability, but be subject to safeguards to \"protect sensitive information\". . While such provisions in the directive could make businesses \"unhappy\", Sarah Cameron, technology legal director at law firm Pinsent Masons, said the rules helped clarify liability for AI-enabled products for consumers and businesses alike. . \"A major barrier to businesses adopting AI has been the complexity, autonomy and opacity (the so-called black box effect) of AI, creating uncertainty around establishing liability and with whom it sits,\" she said. . \"The proposal will ensure that when AI systems are defective and cause physical damage or data loss, it's possible to seek compensation from the AI-system provider or from any manufacturer that integrates an AI system into another product.\" .", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-63033084", "related_stories": ["Google engineer says AI system may have feelings", "Clearview AI fined for storing UK facial images", "The AI that helps create your own hit music tracks"], "related_topics": ["Artificial intelligence", "European Commission", "Drones", "European Union"]},

Experts agree that without big reductions in China's emissions, the world cannot win the fight against climate change. In 2020, China's President Xi Jinping said his country would aim for its emissions to reach their highest point before 2030 and for carbon neutrality before 2060. . His statement has now been confirmed as China's official position ahead of the COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow. But China has not said exactly how these goals will be achieved.  . While all countries face problems getting their emissions down, China is facing the biggest challenge. . Per person, China's emissions are about half those of the US, but its huge 1.4 billion population and explosive economic growth have pushed it way ahead of any other country in its overall emissions. . China became the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide in 2006 and is now responsible for more than a quarter of the world's overall greenhouse gas emissions. . It is expected to come under intense scrutiny at the COP26 summit over its commitments to reduce these. . Along with all the other signatories to the Paris Agreement in 2015, China agreed to make changes to try to keep global warming at 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, and \"well below\" 2C. China strengthened its commitments in 2020, but Climate Action Tracker, an international group of scientists and policy experts say its current actions to meet that goal are \"highly insufficient\".  . Getting China's emissions down is achievable, according to many experts, but will require a radical shift. Coal has been the country's main source of energy for decades. President Xi says China will \"phase down\" coal use from 2026 - and will . not build new coal-fired projects abroad.  - but some governments and campaigners . say the plans are not going far enough. . . Researchers at . Tsinghua University in Beijing say.  China will need to stop using coal entirely for generating electricity by 2050, to be replaced by nuclear and renewable energy production. . And far from shutting down coal-fired power stations, China is currently building new ones at more than 60 locations across the country, with many sites having more than one plant. New stations are usually active for 30 to 40 years, so China will need to reduce the capacity of newer plants as well as close old ones if it is to bring emissions down, says researcher Philippe Ciais of the Institute of Environment and Climate Science in Paris.   . It may be possible to retrofit some to capture emissions, but the technology to do so at scale is still developing, and many plants will have to be written off after minimal use. . China argues it has a right to do what Western countries have done in the past, releasing carbon dioxide in the process of developing its economy and reducing poverty. In the short term, Beijing has ordered coal mines to . increase production.  to avoid power shortages over the coming winter. Surging demand from heavy industry in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic has led to shortages in several regions of the country in recent weeks. Tsinghua University researchers say 90% of power should come from nuclear and renewables by 2050. In moving towards that goal, China's lead in the manufacture of green technology, such as solar panels and large-scale batteries, may be a big help. . China first embraced green technologies as a means to tackle air pollution, a serious problem for many cities. . But the government also believes they have enormous economic potential, providing jobs and income for millions of Chinese, as well as reducing China's dependence on foreign oil and gas. \"China is already leading the global energy transition,\" says Yue Cao of the Overseas Development Institute. \"One of the reasons we are able to deploy cheaper and cheaper green technology is China.\" . China generates more solar power than any other country. That might not be so impressive given China's enormous population, but it is a sign of where the country is heading. China's wind power installations were more than triple those of any other country in 2020. China says the proportion of its energy generated from non-fossil fuel sources should be 25% by 2030, and it is expected by many observers to hit the target early. . China ranks seventh in the world for its percentage of car sales that are electric, but given its huge size, China makes and buys more electric cars than any other country by a considerable margin. . Currently, about one in 20 cars bought in China is electric-powered. By 2035, Chinese officials and car industry representatives are predicting that almost all new vehicles sold in China will be fully electric-powered or hybrid. Working out by how much the shift to electric vehicles reduces emissions is not straightforward - particularly when taking into account manufacturing and charging sources. . But studies suggest that emissions over the lifetimes of electric vehicles are typically below those of petrol and diesel equivalents. . This matters because transport is responsible for around a quarter of carbon emissions from fuel combustion, with . road vehicles.  being the largest emitters. . China will also by 2025 be producing batteries with double the capacity of those produced by the rest of the world combined. Observers say that will enable the storage and release of energy from renewable sources on a previously impossible scale. Getting to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions doesn't mean that China will stop producing emissions. It means China will cut emissions as much as possible and absorb what's left, through a combination of different approaches. Increasing the area of land covered in vegetation will help, as plants absorb carbon dioxide. Here again, there is encouraging news. China is . getting greener.  at a faster rate than any other country, largely as a result of its forestry programmes designed to reduce soil erosion and pollution. It is also partly a result of replanting fields to produce more than one harvest per year, which keeps land covered in vegetation for longer. . The world needs China to succeed. . \"Unless China decarbonises, we're not going to beat climate change,\" says prof David Tyfield of the Lancaster Environment Centre. China has some big advantages, particularly its capacity to stick to long-term strategies and mobilise large-scale investments.  . The Chinese authorities are facing a colossal task.

More than 40 countries have promised to phase out coal by 2050, and another 100 leaders have pledged to end and reverse deforestation by 2030. . The US and EU, meanwhile, announced that they would partner up to cut methane emissions. BBC reporters across the globe - from Shanghai to Sao Paulo - explain how the summit and the climate pledges are going down in their countries. Chinese social media has not been flooded with criticism of the West at COP26, writes . Stephen McDonell.  in Beijing. The response in China's state-controlled media to the climate summit has been fairly muted. It's not that ordinary people in China don't know that the conference is taking place, but the coverage of it has definitely been downplayed. Perhaps Xi Jinping choosing not to attend the gathering was a key factor. To report on it might draw attention to the fact that, unlike other major nations, nobody represented China at leader level. Also, China's media is of the Communist Party and for the Communist Party. Coverage of anything involving Mr Xi, who is the General Secretary of the Party, is tightly controlled. Media outlets here would not ignore such a meeting - to which Mr Xi sent a message in lieu of an appearance - unless they had been ordered to. Of course the conference has, at various points, been referred to. Nationalist stirrers - like those featured in the Global Times - have criticised US President Joe Biden, particularly after he singled out his Chinese counterpart for not showing up. But Chinese social media have not been flooded with criticism of the West at COP26 - it's all been fairly subdued. Perhaps, for climate scientists wanting to build a sense of urgency and momentum out of this summit, ignoring what's happening there may be worse than attacking it. It's all about domestic politics, writes . Laura Trevelyan.  in New York. President Biden was determined to use COP26 to showcase American leadership on climate on the world stage - but, as MSNBC opinion columnist Hayes Brown noted, first of all, he had to apologise. Since President Trump pulled the US out of the Paris climate accord, that \"put us sort of behind the eight ball a little bit,' he acknowledged on the summit's first day. . The US has a see-saw approach to global climate agreements depending on which party has the presidency. So Americans know that whatever is agreed in Glasgow could be reversed by a Republican president in 2025. The conservative-leaning Wall St Journal pointed out that President Biden tried to paint Russia and China as \"isolated holdouts\" to a global consensus on reducing emissions but efforts by the US and its allies failed to get Moscow and Beijing to budge. At home it's the position of Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, a crucial vote when it comes to getting a $500bn climate plan through Congress, that's getting attention. Mr Manchin is from a coal producing state, West Virginia, and when he said he had lingering concerns about the spending package, headlines declared: \"Biden's climate pledge risks being undermined by holdout senator.\". There is no sense of a climate emergency in Russia, writes . Steve Rosenberg.  in Moscow. Go compare. . A British newspaper headline this week - Queen's plea to save our 'fragile' planet. Russia's most popular (pro-Kremlin) daily - Should we really be scared of global warming?. It concluded we shouldn't, claiming there are \"positive consequences of global warming\" (especially for Russia): lower heating bills, more accessible shipping routes. There's no sense here of a climate emergency. . Not that the Kremlin denies there's a problem. It points out that the climate in Russia is warming 2.5 times faster than the world average. . It sent a big delegation to Glasgow. No president, though. Vladimir Putin appeared by video screen only. . Still, Russia promises to be carbon neutral by 2060. It signed the Glasgow declaration on forests and land use, pledging an end to deforestation by 2030. But it wouldn't sign up to cutting methane emissions 30% by 2030. Russia is a fossil fuel superpower and wants a \"smooth\" (longer) transition to greener energy. \"Everybody wants Russia to do more to achieve carbon neutrality as soon as possible,\" Vasily Yablokov of Greenpeace Russia tells me. . \"I'm happy Russia now accepts climate change is happening, but I see no high ambition from our country. It looks like the Russian government's from another planet.\" . India's 2070 net zero pledge has won Narendra Modi applause in a growing nation balancing economic and environmental needs, writes . Rajini Vaidyanathan.  in Delhi. Although India has been a big talking point among policy makers in the weeks leading up to the COP summit, COP hasn't been such a big topic for India's masses. But on Monday, when Prime Minister Modi announced that the country would commit to net zero by 2070, many who weren't paying much attention to goings on in Glasgow finally took note. . Mr Modi's address was broadcast on prime time here, and while some around the world are frustrated India is signing up to meet these goals two decades later than the global 2050 target, here the pledges were seen as pragmatic in a growing country which needs to balance both economic and environmental needs. . They were also viewed by many as a reminder that the PM won't succumb to pressure when the West has long reaped the benefits of growth while polluting. As Mr Modi reminded the summit, \"India, which is 17% of the world population, is responsible for less than 5% of emissions\" - a line that many here applauded. . The First Post news website called the 2070 pledge a \"bold decision... without capitulating to the uncalled for bullying by the West\". And climate experts here say India's four shorter-term goals - to scale up renewables and reduce carbon emissions by 2030 - are also significant. Australia's part in the Cop26 summit is overshadowed by politics writes.  Shaimaa Khalil.  in Sydney. Part of Scott Morrison's job at Cop26 was to explain to the world how he was going to deliver on net zero by 2050 without phasing out coal. But the prime minister's trip to Glasgow was overshadowed by a row with French President Emmanuel Macron - and not about the climate, about submarines.  . On Sunday in Glasgow, Mr Macron accused Mr Morrison of lying to him about a $37bn deal with France which collapsed under controversial circumstances. Mr Morrison replied by saying his nation would not accept \"sledging\" or \"slurs\". . And so this past week, rather than discussing the pressing climate debate and what Australia had achieved at COP26, most of the commentary here has been about Mr Morrison's character and whether the row will affect his standing domestically. \"Slipperiness is Scott Morrison's defining characteristic,\" wrote journalist Hugh Riminton in the Guardian. \"And it was never more on show than this week as he sold \"the Australian Way\" on climate to a sceptical crowd in Glasgow, while openly being branded a liar by France.\". Australia did make a few climate headlines in Glasgow. Along with China, Russia, India and Iran, it snubbed the international pledge to reduce methane emissions by 30% by 2030, and refused to sign up to phasing out coal-fired power and stop investing in new coal plants at home and abroad.  . The verdict from Australia's ABC News? A \"terribly messy week\" for the prime minister. The climate conference in Scotland feels a long way from the reality of most Brazilians, writes . Katy Watson.  in S\u00e3o Paulo. Much is made of Brazil's contribution to climate change internationally because of its immense rainforest. But with all that President Jair Bolsonaro says and does - and the fact he didn't even attend COP26 - it feels a bit different over here. . Yes, the Amazon is in the same country, but it's a long way from big cities like S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio, and probably feels just as distant as a climate conference in Scotland. . It's not that Brazilians don't care. \"People do want to participate and they have lots to contribute,\" says Silvia Cervellini, co-founder of Delibera, a Brazilian organisation helping people get involved in politics. But since the pandemic, there's been a rise in poverty and the political and economic crisis is casting a shadow over Brazil. People have more immediate concerns. \"What we need to do is enable people to make the connection with daily life,\" Ms Cervellini says. . And that's something that dressmaker Izildete Maria de Sousa Botelho agrees with. The 67-year-old from Minas Gerais state was selected to be part of the Global Citizen Assembly for COP. \"If we are cutting down trees, we need to rethink what we eat,\" she says. \"We outsource the responsibility to authorities and politicians and forget that it's individual actions, it's the lack of ecological awareness that we need to work on that is causing all of this.\". Many in Iran believe that it is unfair to expect the country to make any climate commitments while the sanctions remain, writes BBC Persian Service correspondent . Siavash Ardalan. . Iran is among the top 10 emitters of greenhouse gases and suffers extensively from the effects of global warming. The country has seen one its worst droughts in decades this year, . resulting in severe water shortages.  and electricity blackouts. US sanctions and unsustainable domestic policies have only exacerbated such problems. One member of Iran's delegation to COP26 has said that if the sanctions were lifted, \"there would be no obstacle for us to reduce our emissions\". However, conservatives affiliated to President Ebrahim Raisi's government have put out statements that range from climate change denial to assertions COP26 is seeking to deprive Iran of its oil and gas. Although the summit has been largely ignored by Iranian media, such critical views have made their way to some pro-government conservative outlets. A few reform-minded newspapers have meanwhile echoed the dire warnings from UN officials and climate scientists while avoiding any critique of the government's low-key approach to COP26. . Public opinion is divided. Many believe that it is unfair to expect any commitments from Iran while the sanctions remain in place. Others argue that climate change has only served to downplay government incompetence. . COP26 is not front page news in Nigeria, writes.  Nduka Orjinmo.  in Abuja. Nigeria, Africa's largest oil exporter, has promised zero emissions by 2060. The big media houses have sent reporters to Glasgow but it is not front page news in Nigeria. . On Wednesday, President Muhammadu Buhari said no-one in Nigeria needed \"persuading of the need for urgent action on the environment,\" pointing to desertification, floods and erosion in the country as \"enough evidence\". But he wants access to climate finance - some of the $100bn annually available to developing economies - and foreign investment in Nigeria's gas sector to help the country wean itself off its major revenue earner, oil. The president struck the right notes for those in Glasgow but back home people, in homes powered by gasoline generators imported from China, live in a different reality. No-one here has experienced a stable power supply in their lifetime and if it takes burning coal to achieve that, few will reject it for the sake of the climate. Climate activists, especially in the oil-producing Niger Delta region, have long sounded the alarm about the impact of oil drilling and gas flaring but there is little sign of any action from the government and the international oil firms. Even as Saudi Arabia seeks to achieve net zero by 2060, the country is boosting its oil production, writes Middle East Business Correspondent.  Sameer Hashmi. . For a long time, the world's largest oil exporter, Saudi Arabia, had resisted calls from Western countries to set a definite target to reduce carbon emissions. . Then last month, the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, announced that the country had set a goal of reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2060. . But, even as the Saudis seek to achieve that objective, they are boosting their oil production capacity to cater for global demand. The country's top officials have repeatedly said tackling climate change is necessary, but that it cannot be done by \"demonising\" hydrocarbons. The energy minister believes the world needs both fossil fuels as well as renewables. Most officials I spoke to there supported the crown prince's goal and his efforts to promote economic diversification by investing in new industries.

Countries were given a . deadline of September to submit new plans.  - but currently only 11 countries out of 196 have done so. However, recent analysis suggests that . China has seen a continuous reduction in emissions.  since summer 2021. This could have a significant impact as it is responsible for 27% of the world's emissions. What is COP and the Bonn Climate Change Conference?. What was agreed at COP26?. What was agreed?. COP26 included a plan to reduce use of coal - which is responsible for 40% of annual CO2 emissions. . World leaders also agreed to phase-out inefficient oil and gas subsidies. These are government payments that artificially lower the price of fossil fuels. . Why does it matter?. The UN climate science body, the IPCC, says . fossil fuels are responsible for 64% of the world's CO2 emissions. .  . What's been done?. There are are now 34 countries . considering new coal plants. , compared with 41 at the beginning of last year. China, . the biggest user of coal. , agreed . to stop funding.  \"all overseas coal-fired power projects completely\". . However, India - the next largest consumer of coal - . announced in April.  that it was increasing production of coal power and reopening 100 plants. . Fossil fuel subsidies also increased in 2021, . according to the International Energy Agency.  (IEA). But Sabrina Muller, policy analyst at the London School of Economics, thinks this is . a short-term measure to move away from Russian gas. . What was agreed?. More than 100 countries - with about 85% of the world's forests - . promised to stop deforestation.  by 2030. Why does it matter?. This is seen as vital, as trees absorb . about 10% of the CO2 emitted each year. What's been done?. Half the world's forests are in just five countries - Russia, Brazil, Canada, the US and China - so their actions could make a big difference. In April, US President Biden . signed an order . to protect old-growth forests on government land. . But in Brazil - home to more than half of the Amazon rainforest - . deforestation is up 69% on last year. . Frances Seymour of research group the World Resources Institute (WRI) said this was not surprising \"in light of the relaxation of environmental enforcement\" by Brazil's government. Another challenge is in Russia, which is facing a significant wildfire season. It lost . 6.5 million hectares of forest to fires last year. . What was agreed?. Richer countries agreed to provide $100bn (\u00a372bn) a year to developing nations for climate action by the end of 2022 - a pledge that was missed in 2020. . Why does it matter?. Developing nations need the money to move away from fossil fuels, by doing things like investing in green technologies. They also need to prepare for the worst impacts of climate change. . What's been done?. Despite the EU, US, Canada and Australia all increasing funding pledges, . the WRI says they need to spend more.  because of their relative wealth and previous emissions. The UK, France, Germany and Japan are matching or providing more than needed. What was agreed?. A . scheme to cut 30% of methane emissions by 2030.  was agreed by more than 100 countries. .

Methane is currently responsible for a third of human-generated warming.  . What's been done?. Last year, methane levels had seen their biggest annual increase since records began, . according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. . . Farming and the energy sector are the main sources of methane - and the increase in oil and gas use as Covid measures ease could be partially responsible. Top image from Getty Images.

It aims to reduce the worst impacts of climate change - but some leaders and campaigners say it does not go far enough. The agreement - although not legally binding - will set the global agenda on climate change for the next decade:. Emissions. It was agreed countries will meet next year to pledge further cuts to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) - a . greenhouse gas which causes climate change. . This is to try to keep temperature rises within 1.5C - which scientists say is required to prevent a \"climate catastrophe\". Current pledges, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C. . Coal. For the first time at a COP conference, there was an explicit plan to reduce use of coal - which is responsible for 40% of annual CO2 emissions.  . However, countries only agreed a weaker commitment to \"phase down\" rather than \"phase out\" coal after a late intervention by China and India. . Developing countries. The agreement pledged to significantly increase money to help poor countries cope with the effects of climate change and make the switch to clean energy. There's also the prospect of a trillion dollar a year fund from 2025 - after a previous pledge for richer countries to provide $100bn (\u00a372bn) a year by 2020 was missed. While some observers say the COP26 agreement represented the \"start of a breakthrough\", some African and Latin American countries felt not enough progress was made. . Fossil fuel subsidies. World leaders agreed to phase-out subsidies that artificially lower the price of coal, oil, or natural gas. However, no firm dates have been set. A flurry of other announcements were made:. The world's biggest CO2 emitters, the US and China, . pledged to cooperate more over the next decade.  in areas including methane emissions and the switch to clean energy. China has previously been reluctant to tackle domestic coal emissions - so this was seen as recognising the need for urgent action. .

Similar initiatives . haven't stopped deforestation. , but this one's better funded. However, it's unclear how the pledge will be policed. A . scheme to cut 30% of methane emissions by 2030.  was agreed by more than 100 countries. . Methane is currently responsible for a third of human-generated warming. . The big emitters China, Russia and India haven't joined - but it's hoped they will later. Financial organisations controlling $130tn . agreed to back \"clean\" technology. , such as renewable energy, and direct finance away from fossil fuel-burning industries. The initiative is an attempt to involve private companies in meeting net zero targets. However, some environmental organisations have said without a greater commitment to ending support for fossil-fuels, this could be little more than a PR exercise. . Most commitments made at COP will have to be self-policed. Only a few countries are making their pledges legally binding. . COP26 was the moment countries revisited climate pledges made made under the 2015 . Paris Agreement. . . Six years ago, countries were asked to make changes to keep global warming \"well below\" 2C - and to try to aim for 1.5C. COP stands for \"Conference of the Parties\", and the one in Glasgow was the 26th annual summit. Ahead of it, 200 countries were asked for their plans to cut emissions by 2030. . The goal is to keep cutting emissions until they reach . net zero.  by mid-century. Next year's COP27 summit is in Egypt. Top image from Getty Images.

Weather readings dating back more than a century point to long-term changes in the UK's temperature. Yes, Britain has been slowly getting warmer since the 19th Century. In the past three decades, the . UK has become 0.9C warmer. . . The 10 hottest years since 1884 have all happened since 2002. And none of the coldest years has been recorded this century. In 2019, Cambridge saw the hottest temperature ever captured in the UK: 38.7C. . The summer of 2018 was the UK's second-warmest - shared with 1995 - since 1884. The hottest was in 1976. . A heatwave is a period of hot weather where temperatures are higher than is expected for the time of year. In the UK, the Met Office declares a heatwave when it records at least three days in a row with maximum temperatures exceeding a set temperature. That threshold varies by county. Heatwaves usually happen in summer when high pressure develops over an area. . They can also bring so-called \"tropical nights\" - when night-time temperatures fail to drop below 20C. . That can make it hard to sleep at night and the body can suffer, as it fails to sufficiently cool down. The Met Office says it's not clear whether heatwaves are becoming more frequent because of their sporadic nature. . Climate change is . causing global temperatures to rise. . Greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, released into Earth's atmosphere in large volumes are trapping the sun's heat, causing the planet to warm. This has brought more extreme weather, including record-breaking high temperatures across the world. Periods of intense heat do occur within natural weather patterns, . but scientists say.  that globally they are becoming more frequent, more intense and are lasting longer as a result of global warming.

Climate scientists say the answer is climate change. . The Met Office estimates that the extreme heat we are seeing has been made ten times more likely because of it. . We are being warned it can pose a life-threatening risk to even normally healthy people, and just look at the impact it is having in our hospitals, schools and transport systems. . Now remember, this is happening when average world temperatures have only risen just over 1C beyond levels seen before many parts of the world became industrialised. One degree doesn't sound much, does it?  But we're living in the hottest period for 125,000 years, according to the UN's climate science body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). We know what's behind this - the greenhouse gas emissions caused by our burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas, which trap heat in our atmosphere. They have helped push the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to the highest levels seen for 2 million years, according to the IPCC. . So where is our climate headed? . The target set by the UN is to limit global temperature increases to 1.5C higher than pre-industrial levels.  It says that should avoid the most dangerous impacts of climate change. To do that, emissions need to have peaked by 2025 - yes, in only two and half years. . CO2 emissions from energy increased by 6% in 2021 to 36.3 billion tonnes - the highest ever level, the International Energy Agency estimates. They need to virtually halve by 2030 - we need a minimum 43% reduction by the end of this decade, according to the IPCC. . Then the world needs to scale back emissions to net zero by 2050.  That means cutting greenhouse gases as much as possible and finding ways to draw CO2 out of the atmosphere to make up for any that remain. It is a huge challenge - many people believe the greatest challenge humanity has ever faced. . Remember that big UN conference in Glasgow last year? If all the promises governments made there were actually implemented, then we'd be looking at temperatures rising by something like 2.4C from pre-industrial levels by the end of the century. . But the truth is even if we do succeed in reducing emissions to that really ambitious 1.5C target, UK summers will continue to get hotter. . \"In a few decades this might actually be a quite a cool summer,\" says Professor Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College London. We should expect more and longer heatwaves in the future, says Professor Nigel Arnell, a climate scientist at Reading University. We will be seeing more heat-health alerts, more heat-stress days - days when it is too hot to work - and damaging heat extremes to increase, he warns. . So what is the UK doing about it?. Nowhere near enough, is the stark conclusion of the Climate Change Committee (CCC), the government's advisors on climate change. Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned the world was at \"one minute to midnight\" on climate change in his speech opening the Glasgow climate conference. . But in a report on the UK's progress towards net zero the CCC warned that his government's current policies are very unlikely to do the job. It said the government has set a lot of targets and put a lot of policies in place but warns there is \"scant evidence\" these goals will be delivered. And the country is not doing enough to prepare itself for the more frequent and intense heatwaves climate change will bring. Heatwaves caused an additional 2,000 deaths in 2020, according to the UK Health Security Agency. . That figure is likely to triple in coming decades without government action, according to Baroness Brown, deputy chair of the Climate Change Committee. \"We've been telling the government for over 10 years that we are nothing like well enough prepared in the UK for the really hot weather we are seeing now,\" she says - particularly the extreme heat many people experience in their homes. . It is a \"disgrace\" people are dying of heat - or for that matter cold - in the UK, says Professor Hannah Cloke of the University of Reading. Most UK buildings and infrastructure were not designed to cope with the kind of temperatures we are seeing this week and much more needs to be done to adapt them, she says. \"We have made great strides in forecasting extreme weather and climate conditions in recent years. Now we need the systems in place so that people and governments act on the warnings we can provide, whether three hours, three days, or three decades in advance.\".", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-62207466", "related_stories": [], "related_topics": ["UK heatwaves", "Climate change", "Environment"]},

Environmental groups and some farmers worry the government could water down the overhaul, known as environmental land management schemes (ELMS), but the NFU farm union had requested a delay. ELMS is designed to replace the EU's common agricultural policy (CAP). A government spokesperson confirmed it was \"rapidly reviewing\" its plans. ELMS.  was the biggest shake-up of farm policy in England for 40 years, introduced after Brexit to replace the EU's CAP payouts. . Those grants were worth about \u00a33.5bn annually and the majority were paid based on how much land each individual farmer owned, leading to criticisms that the payments benefited the wealthiest. The new ELMS subsidy framework was cast into doubt after a number of landowners and farmers had meetings about the scheme with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs cancelled. News of the review prompted an unusually outspoken statement from the director-general of the National Trust, Hilary McGrady. \"Rather than ramp up action to support our environment, this government appears however to be heading in the opposite direction,\" she said. Cambridgeshire farmer Martin Lines, who is chairman of the Nature Friendly Farming Network, which promotes sustainable farming, said that any delay to the ELMS scheme would deny farmers crucial support to adapt to a changing climate. . \"If the government is stalling ELMS, it is failing any duty of leadership in maintaining momentum and building resilience,\" he said. ELMS is made up of three payment schemes - the sustainable farming incentive, local nature recovery and landscape recovery. Under the system, farmers could be paid subsidies based on a range of environmental work, from improving water and soil health and creating wildlife habitats to rewilding whole landscapes. But those with smaller farms had voiced concerns that the new nature-friendly system would not offer them enough to stay in business. NFU president Minette Batters said her organisation had wanted a delay to the schemes' introduction. \"We called for a delay not because we wanted to hang on to the status quo but because we believe that the SFI needed to have more detail and it needs to be profitable,\" she said. \"We have always been calling for a better policy, one that does deliver for food production and for the environment.\". She also argued that the larger-scale rewilding projects should be paid for with private money, not public funds. \"We have got literally billions and billions of pounds in green finance that is looking to invest in wild environments. We should be making the private sector work effectively,\" she said. . A.  report . earlier this year by think tank the Green Alliance estimated that delaying ELMS by two years would reduce the savings in agricultural emissions delivered by 2035 by half. News of the review triggered warnings from environmental groups. Craig Bennett, chief executive of The Wildlife Trusts, said \"If we revert to an agricultural system where people get given taxpayers' money on the basis of how much land they own then one of the few potential benefits of Brexit will have been squandered. It will be unfair and unsustainable.\". Richard Benwell, chief executive of Wildlife and Countryside Link, a coalition of rural conservation charities, said: \"Farmers should be paid more and paid well for ambitious action to deliver environmental recovery, alongside producing healthy food.\". He said any suggestion farmers be paid based on the amount of land they owned \"would squander years of work and waste the opportunity to create a thriving agriculture sector that works in harmony with nature. Area-based payments are inefficient and inequitable\". . A Defra spokeswoman said that, while environmental land management remained important, the department was reviewing its plans \"given the pressures on farmers, and the government's aims of boosting food security and economic growth\". . She added: \"In the light of the current global economic situation, we know that the cost of inputs has gone up, which might make it more difficult for farmers to both improve the natural environment and underpin food production, so we will continue our engagement with the sector to make sure the outcomes that the British people want to see are delivered.\". Agricultural policy in the UK is a devolved responsibility and each nation is implementing its own subsidy schemes.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-63029266", "related_stories": ["Next steps in England's rural revolution unveiled", "Farmers could be paid for post-Brexit land changes", "New plan to pay farmers who protect winter soil", "Farm subsidy reforms a distraction to 'buy us off'"], "related_topics": ["Intensive farming"]},

Left unchecked, humans and nature will experience catastrophic warming, with worsening droughts, greater sea level rise and mass extinction of species. . We face a huge challenge, but there are potential solutions. Climate is the average weather in a place over many years. Climate change is a shift in those average conditions. The rapid climate change we are now seeing is caused by humans using oil, gas and coal for their homes, factories and transport. . When these fossil fuels burn, they release greenhouse gases - mostly carbon dioxide (CO2). These gases trap the Sun's heat and cause the planet's temperature to rise. The world is now about 1.2C warmer than it was in the 19th Century - and . the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has risen by 50%. . Temperature rises must slow down if we want to avoid the worst consequences of climate change, scientists say. They say global warming needs to be . kept to 1.5C by 2100. . . However, unless further action is taken, . the planet could still warm by more than 2C.  by the end of this century. A report in 2021 by the Climate Action Tracker group calculated that the world was heading for . 2.4C of warming by the end of the century. If nothing is done, . scientists think global warming could exceed 4C.  in the future, leading to devastating heatwaves, millions losing their homes to rising sea levels and irreversible loss of plant and animal species. . Extreme weather events are already more intense, threatening lives and livelihoods. . With further warming, some regions could become uninhabitable, as . farmland turns into desert. . In other regions, the opposite is happening, with extreme rainfall causing historic flooding - as seen recently in China, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. People in poorer countries will suffer the most as they do not have the money to adapt to climate change. Many farms in developing countries already have to endure climates that are too hot and this will only get worse. Our oceans and its habitats are also under threat. The Great Barrier Reef in Australia, for example, has already . lost half of its corals since 1995.  due to warmer seas driven by climate change. Wildfires are becoming more frequent.  as climate change increases the risk of hot, dry weather. . And as frozen ground melts in places like Siberia, greenhouse gases trapped for centuries will be released into the atmosphere, worsening climate change. In a warmer world, animals will find it harder to find the food and water they need to live. For example, polar bears could die out as the ice they rely on melts away, and elephants will struggle to find the 150-300 litres of water a day they need. Scientists believe . at least 550 species could be lost this century.  if action is not taken. . Climate change has different effects in different areas of the world. Some places will warm more than others, some will receive more rainfall and others will face more droughts. . If temperature rise cannot be kept within 1.5C:. Countries agree climate change can only be tackled by working together, and in a landmark agreement in Paris in 2015, they pledged to try to keep global warming to 1.5C. . The UK is hosting a summit for world leaders, . called COP26,.  in November, where countries will set out their carbon reduction plans for 2030. . Many countries have pledged to get to net zero by 2050. This means reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible and balancing out remaining emissions by absorbing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere. Experts agree that . this is achievable. , but it will require governments, businesses and individuals to make big changes. Major changes need to come from governments and businesses, but scientists say some small changes in our lives . can limit our impact on the climate. :. The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives. Top image from Getty Images.

But did you ever wonder what it takes to make the scoop on your cone?  . This traditional treat dates back centuries, but today many frozen desserts are the culmination of months of research and development. On the outskirts of the Danish city Aarhus is what might be considered ice cream's answer to Silicon Valley. . Among a cluster of businesses, including dairy producers, engineers and service providers, is a manufacturing plant owned by food packaging giant Tetra Pak. . This place is also home to a product development centre where future recipes and technology are tested out. . \"It's the first step in a long journey to having a product launched,\" says Elsebeth Baungaard, portfolio manager at Tetra Pak. \"We're testing what we will see on the market next summer or two years from now.\" . Inside the bright laboratory are steel vats, freezers and a machine turning out oval-shaped ice creams onto a conveyor belt.  . Tetra Pak's clients - the world's major ice cream brands - often spend two or three days in the facility making and tasting samples. . \"We see how the mouthfeel is, the texture, and if it's working,\" she explains. . There are also a variety of experts at hand to help out with the process along the way, including specialist \"stick inserters\". . The facility allows customers to try new recipes without tying up their own production. New products are released in late spring, then manufacturing ramps up ready for summer. \"There's a lot of investment in innovation during the winter,\" says Tetra Pak's Ice Cream Academy manager Torben Vilsgaard. . The US and China are the biggest consumers, and according to Tetra Pak, more than 25 billion litres were eaten worldwide in 2021.  . Meanwhile in the UK, sizzling summer temperatures have sent ice cream sales soaring. Data from NielsenIQ shows purchases were 28% higher in the four weeks to mid-August, compared a year earlier. . But just how is this delicious treat made? . Production starts with the mix. Milk or water is combined with dry ingredients such as milk solids, sugars and dairy or vegetable fats. The liquid is heated and homogenised, then cooled and \"aged\". Dressed in a white lab coat, Mr Vilsgaard walks me through the process. \"We add functional ingredients like flavours and colours, but also stabilisers and the emulsifier. \"They give some viscosity. That is the mouthfeel, when it's consumed and melting down.\" . Next it's pumped to a continuous freezer. \"This is the heart of any ice cream production facility,\" he says. This \"small\" unit can make 700 litres an hour, but commercial-scale freezers can produce up to 4,000. . Inside a rotating cylinder the mix is rapidly cooled and beaten, while incorporating air. The ice cream emerges slightly soft, so it can be pumped into a tub or mould, then stored at a lower temperature.  . While the recipe sounds simple, ice cream has a complex chemistry consisting of ice crystals, air bubbles and fat globules, held in a water and sugar solution. . \"It's one of the few products that holds all three states at once. It's solid, liquid and gas, all in one,\" says Dr Chika Nweke, a fellow in biochemical engineering, who teaches ice cream manufacturing at University College London. . \"Normally liquids and oils don't mix very well. But with the addition of the emulsifier you get the fats in the ice cream sticking together with the liquids,\" she says. . Getting the balance right is a precise science and it's important for the ice cream's stability. Recipes have really evolved, says Dr Nweke, and there is a lot of research going into new ingredients, particularly alternatives to lactose or sugars. . However, there are also some rather more unexpected components. \"Up to 50% of it can be air,\" says Dr Nweke, revealing that it's crucial to making the ice cream \"scoop-able\". . More technology of business:. Commercial production is increasingly automated and at Tetra Pak engineers are tinkering with a new factory line capable of making a million ice creams a day.  . The firm estimates that half of the world's ice cream output is made using its equipment. . Recently it supplied one of the first collaborative robots, known as a cobot, where staff work alongside it filling ice cream bowls. . Designers are also developing special nozzles to make complex shapes like animals, or multiple layers of different flavours, and moulds are 3D printed. . However, keeping ice cream cold is energy-intensive. Elsebeth Baungaard says she and her colleagues are working on a more targeted cooling process that chills specific spots. . Other firms have developed technology that is quite literally \"out of the box\". For example, US firm Cold Snap makes ice cream pods that are only frozen in an appliance when you want to eat it, thereby eliminating the energy consumed by storing it in a freezer. . Back in the lab at Tetra Pak, where future ice creams are tested, I'm keen to get the inside scoop on what's coming next. . \"I'm sorry to say it's simply shrinking. We are downsizing the volume,\" Ms Baungaard replies. \"Small cones, small sticks, the bite-size. But the quality will be higher.\". That's a global trend that Kate Vlietstra, a food and drink analyst from Mintel, also recognises, together with a shift towards more \"indulgent\" flavours over healthier, low-calorie choices. \"People go for affordable treats,\" she says. The firm's research found that 48% of UK consumers think it has been \"easier to justify eating indulgent food or drink since Covid-19\". Ms Vlietstra thinks concerns about the cost-of-living crisis will have a similar impact. \"Ice cream is obviously very affordable, even a premium ice cream, and can offer a great experience at home.\". But while both younger and older consumers buy ice cream regularly, she says it is millennial consumers who are driving interest in more original flavours, including spices like chilli or cardamom. Dairy still dominates, but plant-based ice cream and sorbets are another growing segment. Other new innovations may soon find their way into our freezers. Behind Ms Baungaard is a machine with a wheel that can embed chunks of cookie dough or brownie, known as inclusions, into ice creams on a stick. . \"That's new,\" she says. \"We are the only one on the market who can do it.\" (It is already done in cups.). Another new technique is decorating stick products with patterns or writing. As ice cream samples pass by, you have to wonder if this line of work might be potentially hazardous for dessert lovers. . \"It is absolute temptation,\" Ms Baungaard says. \"But you also get used to it.\".", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62745767", "related_stories": [], "related_topics": ["Companies", "Denmark", "Food"]},

But what's the evidence for global warming and how do we know it's being caused by humans? . Our planet has been warming rapidly since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution.  . The . average temperature at the Earth's surface has risen about 1.1C since 1850. . Furthermore, each of the last four decades has been warmer than any that preceded it, since the middle of the 19th Century. . These conclusions come from analyses of millions of measurements gathered in different parts of the world. The temperature readings are collected by . weather stations on land, on ships and by satellites. . . Multiple independent teams of scientists have reached the same result - a spike in temperatures coinciding with the onset of the industrial era. . Scientists can reconstruct temperature fluctuations even further back in time. . Tree rings, ice cores, lake sediments and corals all record a signature of the past climate. This provides much-needed context to the current phase of warming. In fact, scientists estimate the Earth hasn't been this hot for about 125,000 years. . Greenhouse gases - which trap the Sun's heat - are the crucial link between temperature rise and human activities. The most important is carbon dioxide (CO2), because of its abundance in the atmosphere. We can also tell it's CO2 trapping the Sun's energy. Satellites show less heat from the Earth escaping into space at precisely the wavelengths at which CO2 absorbs radiated energy. . Burning fossil fuels and chopping down trees lead to the release of this greenhouse gas. Both activities exploded after the 19th Century, so it's unsurprising that atmospheric CO2 increased over the same period. . There's a way we can show definitively where this extra CO2 came from. The carbon produced by burning fossil fuels has a distinctive chemical signature. . Tree rings and polar ice both record changes in atmospheric chemistry. When examined they show that carbon - specifically from fossil sources - . has risen significantly since 1850. .  . Analysis shows that for 800,000 years, atmospheric CO2 did not rise above 300 parts per million (ppm). But since the Industrial Revolution, the CO2 concentration has soared to its current level of nearly 420 ppm. Computer simulations, known as climate models, have been used to show what would have happened to temperatures without the massive amounts of greenhouse gases released by humans.  . They reveal there would have been little global warming - and possibly some cooling - over the 20th and 21st Centuries, if only natural factors had been influencing the climate. . Only when human factors are introduced can the models explain increases in temperature.  . The level of heating Earth has experienced already is predicted to cause significant changes to the world around us. . Real-world observations of these changes match patterns scientists expect to see with human-induced warming. They include:. There have been several hot periods during the Earth's past. Around 92 million years ago, for example, temperatures were so high that . there were no polar ice caps and crocodile-like creatures lived as far north as the Canadian Arctic. . . That should not comfort anyone, however, because humans were not around. At times in the past, sea level was 25m (80ft) higher than the present. . A rise of 5-8m (16-26ft) is considered enough to submerge most of the world's coastal cities. . There is abundant evidence for mass extinctions of life during these periods. And climate models suggest that, at times, . the tropics could have become \"dead zones\". , too hot for most species to survive. These fluctuations between hot and cold have been caused by a variety of phenomena, including the way the Earth wobbles as it orbits the Sun over long periods, volcanic eruptions and short-term climate cycles such as El Ni\u00f1o. For many years, groups of so-called climate \"sceptics\" have cast doubt on the scientific basis of global warming. . However, virtually all scientists who publish regularly in peer-reviewed journals now agree on the current causes of climate change.  . A key UN report released in 2021 said it \"is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, oceans and land\". . The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives. Top image credit: Getty Images.

Scientists used artificial intelligence to assess risks to the entire palm family, from tall trees to climbing plants. The data gives a much better idea of how many, and which, palm species are under threat. Palms are a huge plant family that provide millions of people with food, drink and shelter. \"We need to do all we can to protect biodiversity and that encompasses more than a thousand palm species that we now know may be threatened,\" said study leader, Dr Sidonie Bellot of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, London. She said action was needed to conserve plants on the ground and to collect more data on them, which cannot be done without the people who live in the regions where palms grow and who use the palms daily. Palm trees have a host of uses, including as staple crops such as coconut, palm oil or dates, or in the making of furniture, rubber, oil and ropes. Scientists are concerned about extinction risks to lesser-known wild relatives of popular ornamental or commercially grown palms. They say wild plants are invaluable to local people, but could vanish even before their full potential is known. Official assessments of extinction risk are time-consuming and costly, prompting the Kew-led team to investigate machine learning as a tool. Their data suggests more than a thousand species - just over 50% of palms - are threatened with extinction. \"With these predictions we can help to prioritise conservation activity and to target species with further conservation work in the countries where they are most at risk,\" said Dr Steven Bachman, research leader in Kew's conservation assessment and analysis team. The team has designated Madagascar, New Guinea, the Philippines, Hawaii, Borneo, Jamaica, Vietnam, Vanuatu, New Caledonia and Sulawesi as priority regions for palm conservation. . Palms are the most iconic plant group in the tropics and one of the most useful too, added Dr Rodrigo C\u00e1mara-Leret of the University of Zurich, who worked on the study. The study gives a much better idea of how many, and which, palm species are under threat, he said. . Palms are among the most economically important of all plant families, with hundreds of wild species supporting millions of people across the world. They provide building materials for homes and tools, as well as food and medicine for hundreds of communities across the tropics. . According to the research, published in . Nature Ecology and Evolution. , at least 185 palm species that have a use may be threatened in 92 regions, further emphasising the need to protect these plants.

The RSPB, which has a million members, has labelled it an \"unprecedented attack on nature\" that could \"silence the dawn chorus\". Levelling Up Secretary Simon Clarke has insisted the zones are not \"a developers' charter\". But many charities, including the National Trust and Shropshire Wildlife Trust, are unconvinced. . The government's investment zones include plans for a relaxation of planning rules to allow business development, which ministers said would be \"consent-driven\". . Conservation groups fear the repercussions if environmental protections are relaxed to encourage development. RSPB operations director Jeff Knott told BBC Radio Shropshire the ornithological charity was \"absolutely furious\" about the government \"trashing\" environmental protections. He said the investment zones announcement followed the removal of other \"basic site protections\" for habitats and changes to farming subsidies. . \"We're absolutely furious about this,\" he said. . \"We've seen the announcement of so-called investment zones where there are vague plans to remove environmental protections and allow pretty much anything to be built anywhere - they sound much more like destruction zones than investment zones to us. \"When you take all these things together it looks like an unprecedented attack on nature and we're here to be the voice for nature. \"When we're faced with plans that we think would lead to concreting over vast swathes of our beautiful countryside and silencing the dawn chorus, we have no choice but to fight back.\". Conservation groups across the country, including the National Trust and the Wildlife Trust, have supported the RSPB's call for supporters to write to their MPs about the \"ridiculous proposals\". Campaigners in Shropshire, which had . some of the worst flooding in the country.  earlier this year, say they could be particularly badly hit by any planning relaxations. There are already five West Midlands councils on the investment zone shortlist, with further applications still being invited by the government. Shropshire environmental campaigner Christian Dunn said there was serious concern about the removal of planning rules aimed at protecting the area from flooding and water pollution. Dr Dunn, who works for the University of Bangor's School of Natural Sciences, said: \"That means we could potentially see buildings being built where they would not have been allowed before because of concerns for the natural world. \"By having more concrete and less land for rainwater to soak away, we get higher water levels during storm events and we increase the chances of flooding. \"Building more houses with inadequate drainage systems means we're adding pollution to our rivers and seas and if we don't get the underlying planning rules right that will only get worse.\". The Dasgupta government report, . welcomed by former prime minister Boris Johnson.  last year, had stressed how protecting the natural world and the UK economy were \"completely embedded in each other\". The report said: \"If we want a strong economy then we must look after nature as well.\". Shropshire Wildlife Trust CEO Richard Grindle said the government plans were \"bad news\" for rural and predominantly agricultural areas such as Shropshire. Mr Grindle said he was particularly concerned about the impact on farming in the county, which is currently controlled by the Environmental Land Management Systems (ELMS), rewarding good stewardship and not simply land ownership. He said: \"Last year we had the food security review and that said protecting nature - our soils, our rivers, our climate - is essential for food security. So why they're contemplating doing these things now we just don't understand. \"We're not anti-farmers, they are the people who manage our land and look after it for future generations, and most of them care deeply about nature and want to do the right thing. \"It's the farming system of subsidies, protections and rules that prevent them from doing that and the government is taking a big step backwards if it does this.\". Secretary Of State for Levelling Up, Simon Clarke, insisted the investment zones plans had local democracy and consent at their heart. He said: \"Investment zones are a very targeted opportunity to unlock economic growth. \"It's for local authorities to bring forward proposals, so bottom up rather than government leading top down, and it's a consent-driven process. . \"It involves much lower taxes for businesses in these zones and enhanced planning freedoms so we can actually get projects moving.\" .

This year it embraced the digital world. For the 2022 event back in July, an interactive, online map was made available to show where and when to see the 34 huge, ornate floats that paraded across the city of Kyoto over two separate days. Using GPS, it showed the location of each float. And you could also use the map to find your friends and chat with them. In addition, if you clicked on a building or street, you could read about its history in Japanese or English. The person behind the technology is Machi Takahashi, the president and co-chief executive of Kyoto-based, digital map firm Stroly. A mother of two, she is a rare female entrepreneur in a country where the start-up scene is still very much dominated by men. \"I was surprised that [the festival organisers] would let us digitise their map, because I thought these traditional cultural festivals are quite conservative,\" she says. The website-based digital map is accessed by scanning a QR code. Hideo Yoshii, who is in charge of looking after one of the biggest floats, says that Stroly may have gotten some pushback if it had just wanted to put QR code stickers or signs up on walls. Instead Stroly created a pretty postcard that had not just the QR code printed on it, but also the pattern of a traditional Japanese map. This complemented the atmosphere of the ancient event, and was also used as the design for the digital map Stroly made. \"Before the pandemic, we gave out a pamphlet, but tourists found it difficult to navigate the city,\" says a spokeswoman for the city's tourism department. \"By using Stroly's digital map, police officers who are on the ground found it much easier to explain to visitors where to go. We've also managed to reduce our paper waste by a third,\" she adds. . The idea to set up a business making digital maps came to Ms Takahashi and her husband and co-founder Toru while they were both still working at Kyoto-based technology research institute ATR. He is Stroly's chairman and co-chief executive. . One of their first customers was the movie industry theme park Toei Kyoto Studio Park back in 2010. \"We asked Mr and Ms Takahashi to create a game using Nintendo DS,\" says Norihiro Yamaguchi, who was the boss of Toei Kyoto Studio Park at the time. New Tech Economy.  is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape. The map and GPS-based game that the Takahashis produced involved the park's visitors having to locate seven actors playing screen villains. Six years later, the Takahashis left the research institute to set up Stroly as their own business, with the theme park remaining one of its main clients. . \"Thanks to smartphones which allow users to access the Stroly map in different languages, visitors can find out about the details of our shows and facilities,\" says a spokesman for the park. Stroly has now produced almost 10,000 interactive, digital maps, including one highlighting the vibrant nightlife of the busy Shinjuku area of central Tokyo. That was commissioned by the government of the capital city. Other maps include where to find the best cheese in the Tokachi dairy farming region of Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost main island, as well as work for clients outside Japan. For members of the public Stroly's maps are free to use. It instead makes its money by charging its customers, mostly in tourism and transport, annual subscriptions. \"When I started thinking about starting my own business in 2015, there was no woman in this information technology field so I had to find my way into this community,\" says Ms Takahashi. \"I had to actually contact [US-based Japanese entrepreneur] Ari Horie from Women's Startup Lab in Silicon Valley, instead of [anyone] in Japan, to help me out.\". Stroly was subsequently selected as one of the first start-ups to be given mentoring by a new regional business support agency called Osaka Innovation Hub. This was where Ms Takahashi managed to secure funding from Japanese investment bank Daiwa Securities. The firm also later received money from Kyoto City's start-up fund. The difficulty faced by female entrepreneurs is not unique to Japan. Even in the US, . only 2% of venture capital, which invests in new start-ups, went to women last year. In an . article for Vogue magazine.  last month where she announced that she was \"evolving away from tennis\", US sports star Serena Williams said this was part of the reason she launched her own investment fund, Serena Ventures. \"Sometimes like attracts like,\" wrote Williams. \"Men are writing those big cheques to one another, and in order for us to change that, more people who look like me need to be in that position, giving money back to themselves.\". Ms Takahashi agrees. \"The decision-making roles are also mostly [held by] men. I think they simply cannot relate to the problems and issues addressed by women entrepreneurs,\" she says. The Japanese government had wanted to use the five years from 2015 to 2020 . to almost triple the proportion of female managers in the country to reach 30% of the total.  However, the current level is just 15%, compared with . the global average of 31%. . And according to the country's Financial Services Agency, . less than 1% of Japanese venture capital firms are run by women. Kathy Matsui leads one such firm, MPower Partners, which she recently started in Tokyo with two female partners, Yumiko Murakami and Seki Miwa. A former vice chair of investment bank Goldman Sachs Japan, Ms Matsui is best known for her \"womenomics\" drive since the 1990s, which has encouraged the Japanese government . to improve its gender ratio among businesses. . . \"I would say the vast majority of entrepreneurs and founders we've met so far, here in Japan, are male,\" she says. \"But when we think about start-ups, they're trying to use innovation to create disruptive businesses, life-changing technologies. And if you're excluding half the population from your potential talent pool as a start-up, you're already trying to win a marathon on one leg rather than two.\". Back in Kyoto, Ms Takahashi's success in finding a gap in the digital tourism market may be an exception to the male-dominated rule. There is no denying that it is still an uphill battle to create a greater equal footing in Japan's workforce. So does she have any advice for younger entrepreneurs, and particularly female ones? . \"Jump into the ecosystem,\" she says. \"It is very easy to get to know someone in the field, and once you know somebody, it's a great network that you need to expand your business.\".

Anfonodd yr aelod staff, oedd ddim am gael ei enwi, luniau o negeseuon ar wefan Facebook yn dangos y bwrdd yn galw ar weithwyr i weithio oriau ychwanegol oherwydd \"pwysau sylweddol\".

Yn \u00f4l y gweithiwr o Fwrdd Iechyd Cwm Taf Morgannwg a gysylltodd \u00e2 rhaglen Newyddion S4C, mae 'na brinder sylweddol o weithwyr. Esboniodd fod hynny'n rhoi'r staff sy'n gweithio yno dan bwysau eithriadol. Roedd y neges hefyd yn dweud bod y bwrdd wedi dechrau defnyddio gwefan Facebook i ymbil ar staff i weithio oriau ychwanegol. Dywedodd Aelod Senedd Plaid Cymru Heledd Fychan bod y sefyllfa yn \"hynod bryderus\". \"Mae hwn yn dangos yn glir bod y gwasanaeth iechyd dan straen,\" dywedodd. \"I feddwl fod y bwrdd iechyd yn erfyn ar staff i fynd i mewn i'r gwaith er mwyn gallu ateb y galw, mae hynny yn hynod bryderus.\" .

Ond yn \u00f4l Coleg Brenhinol y Meddygon, mae'n ymddangos bod pwysau ar staffio ar draws holl ysbytai Cymru. Fe rannodd y Coleg ystadegau eu harolwg diweddaraf gyda rhaglen Newyddion S4C. Mae eu data ar gyfer 2021 yn dangos bod: .

Cadarnhaodd cadeirydd BMA Cymru, Iona Collins, bod eu haelodau nhw hefyd yn cwyno am brinder staff a dywedodd bod y sefyllfa'n beryglus. \"Mae prinder enbyd staff yn arwain at ohirio triniaethau, rhestrau aros sydd yn tyfu a thorcalon i gleifion sydd yn dioddef drwy Gymru. \"Wythnos ddiwethaf, glywon ni gan aelodau oedd yn gorfod canslo triniaethau oherwydd diffyg staff.

O fis Ebrill 2023 bydd gan awdurdodau lleol yr hawl i dreblu'r premiwm sy'n cael ei godi ar y rheiny sy'n berchen ar fwy nag un eiddo. Mae'r hawl hwnnw wedi ei awdurdodi gan Lywodraeth Cymru, gyda gweinidogion yn gobeithio gwneud hi'n haws i bobl allu prynu cartrefi yn yr ardaloedd ble cawsant eu magu. Ond ar drothwy trafodaethau'r cabinet ddydd Mawrth, fe bwysleisiodd arweinydd y cyngor na ddylai unrhyw fesurau ychwanegol daro'r economi dwristiaeth leol. Wrth siarad gyda Cymru Fyw fe nododd Dyfrig Siencyn hefyd angen i osgoi sefyllfa lle fo pobl leol yn cael eu cosbi o ganlyniad i unrhyw gynnydd arfaethedig. Bydd yr awdurdod yn ymgynghori \u00e2 thrigolion y sir yn y misoedd nesaf, a bydd y cyngor llawn ystyried yr argymhellion terfynol ar 1 Rhagfyr, fel bod modd cyflwyno unrhyw bremiwm newydd o Ebrill 2023 ymlaen. Ers Ebrill 2021 mae Gwynedd, fel sawl cyngor arall yng Nghymru, . yn codi'r uchafswm presennol o 100%.  ychwanegol ar drethi ail gartrefi. Mae'r ymgynghoriad - sy'n ofynnol yn statudol os am fynd ymhellach a chodi'r premiwm hyd at 300% - yn cael ei lansio yn dilyn pryderon fod prisiau tai allan o gyrraedd pobl leol mewn sawl cymuned. Mae ffigyrau diweddaraf y cyngor yn dangos bod 4,656 eiddo yn talu'r premiwm ail gartrefi yng Ngorffennaf 2022. . Roedd yr adroddiad i'r cabinet yn nodi bod \"mynd i'r afael \u00e2 phrinder tai fforddiadwy yn ogystal \u00e2'r nifer uchel o ail gartrefi ymysg prif flaenoriaethau'r cyngor\". Mae gweinidogion Llywodraeth Cymru yn annog cynghorau i roi unrhyw arian ychwanegol a godwyd tuag at gynyddu nifer y tai fforddiadwy. Os fydd y premiwm yn cael ei godi i'r uchafswm newydd, bydd yn golygu bod perchnogion ail gartrefi yn talu hyd at bedair gwaith yr hyn sy'n cael ei dalu mewn treth cyngor gan drigolion llawn amser Gwynedd. Bydd y meini prawf a ddefnyddir ar gyfer diffinio bod llety hunan-ddarpar yn talu ardrethi busnes yn hytrach na'r dreth gyngor hefyd yn newid o fis Ebrill nesaf. Ar hyn o bryd mae eiddo sydd ar gael i'w osod am o leiaf 140 diwrnod, ac sy'n cael ei osod mewn gwirionedd am o leiaf 70 diwrnod, yn talu trethi busnes yn hytrach na'r dreth gyngor. Ond bydd y trothwy newydd yn golygu bod rhaid i'r eiddo fod ar gael i'w osod am o leiaf 252 diwrnod, a chael ei osod mewn gwirionedd am o leiaf 182 diwrnod mewn unrhyw gyfnod o 12 mis, er mwyn osgoi trethi domestig. Dywedodd y llywodraeth y bydd hyn yn ei gwneud hi'n gliriach bod yr eiddo yn llety gwyliau gwirioneddol sy'n gwneud \"cyfraniad sylweddol\" i'r economi leol. Mewn ymateb i gynlluniau Cyngor Gwynedd i gynnal ymgynghoriad dywedodd aelod o'r gr\u0175p Second Home Owners - Wales, sy'n cynrychioli perchnogion ail gartrefi, y byddai \"erlyn perchnogion ail gartrefi ymhellach ond yn annog mwy i drosglwyddo i ardrethi busnes\". Gan bwysleisio fod sawl busnes yn ddibynnol ar berchnogion ail gartrefi a'u gwesteion, ychwanegodd John Rees Moss mai diffyg swyddi a chyfleoedd economaidd yn lleol oedd prif reswm diffyg fforddiadwyedd yn lleol. Dywedodd wrth Cymru Fyw: \"Mae agwedd lefel sir gyfan at y premiwm yn offeryn di-fin. Dim ond ar lefel cyngor plwyf y dylid cyflwyno unrhyw bremiwm, lle mae ail eiddo yn cael effaith sylweddol ar argaeledd a phrisiau tai. \"Mae Llywodraeth Cymru wedi anwybyddu ffynhonnell incwm o bwys drwy ganiat\u00e1u i garafanau sefydlog a phorthdai i beidio \u00e2 thalu unrhyw dreth gyngor, felly'n cyfrannu dim tuag at gyfleusterau cyhoeddus.\". Wrth siarad ar raglen . Dros Frecwast.  fore Mawrth, dywedodd Ian Wyn Jones, arwerthwr tai yn y gogledd, ei fod yn teimlo y byddai codi premiwm o 300% yn ormod. Dywedodd ei fod yn \"deall be' ma'r cyngor yn trio g'neud\", ond fod llawer o berchnogion ail gartrefi yn cyfrannu at gymunedau. \"Mae'n bwysig bo' ni ddim yn pwsho pawb i ffwrdd,\" meddai, gan fod y gogledd yn dibynnu gymaint ar dwristiaeth. Ychwanegodd ei fod wedi gweld mwy o ail gartrefi yn cyrraedd y farchnad, ond fod y rheiny yn aml yn rhy ddrud i'r rheiny sydd eisiau prynu eu t\u0177 cyntaf. Ond yn \u00f4l arweinydd Cyngor Gwynedd, Dyfrig Siencyn, \"mae'r ffaith fod Llywodraeth Cymru wedi cydnabod bod yna broblem, yn gam anferth ymlaen\". Dywedodd wrth Cymru Fyw bod \"nifer o'r camau yn bethau rydym wedi gofyn amdanyn nhw, sef y gofyniad i gael caniat\u00e2d cynllunio i drosi o fod yn d\u0177 annedd i fod yn llety tymor byr\". Gan nodi fod angen mwy o eglurder ar yr elfen drwyddedu, pwysleisiodd mai'r bwriad oedd diogelu'r stoc dai, ac ni ddylai unrhyw fesurau daro pobl leol sy'n berchen ar fusnesau llety gwyliau. Awgrymodd bod posibilrwydd y gall pobl sydd wedi derbyn caniat\u00e2d cynllunio i drosi i lety gwyliau, ond na fyddai'n addas ar gyfer preswylio ynddynt llawn amser, fod yn eithriedig. \"Mae pob aelod, dwi'n si\u0175r, wedi bod yn cael negeseuon gan eu hetholwyr,\" dywedodd wrth Cymru Fyw, gan gydnabod ei fod yn ddadl danbaid yn lleol. \"Mae 'na nifer gyda'r camargraff fod y dreth am godi i 300% beth bynnag, ond tydi hynny ddim yn wir ac yn benderfyniad sydd i'w wneud gan aelodau'r cyngor llawn. \"'Da ni'n gwrando ar y negeseuon gan fod 'na elfennau [o'r mesurau] yn effeithio ar bobl leol i ddweud y gwir, ac ar fusnesau lleol sy'n bwysig iawn i'n heconomi leol.\". Ychwanegodd: \"'Da ni angen bod yn ofalus ein bod, gyn belled ag y gallwn, yn gwarchod yr economi dwristiaeth leol. . \"Nid dyna'n bwriad ni wrth alw am weithredu ar ochr ail gartrefi, ein bwriad ni ydi cael rheolaeth ar y gosod tymor byr yma sy'n tynnu tai annedd allan o'r stoc dai ac sy'n creu problem. \"Mae o'n poethi'r farchnad ac yn cyfrannu at y cynnydd mewn prisiau, sydd yn eithrio pobl leol o'r gallu i fedru prynu t\u0177 ac hefyd yn creu problem gymdeithasol. Mae 'na strydoedd cyfan mewn pentrefi a threfi sydd bellach yn beth fysa rhywun yn ei alw'n dai gwag. \"Dyna 'da ni isho'i reoli, mae o'n digwydd mewn mannau eraill ac dwi'n si\u0175r y gallwn ni gael llwyddiant yma yng Ngwynedd ac yng Nghymru.\".", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/cymrufyw/62804879", "related_stories": ["'Argyfwng tai': Prynwyr yn llythyru at berchnogion", "Gorymdaith i fynnu ateb i'r 'argyfwng ail gartrefi'", "Ail gartrefi: Gallai treth cyngor rhai gynyddu 300%"], "related_topics": ["Economi", "Llywodraeth Cymru", "Tai", "Twristiaeth ", "Cyngor Gwynedd"]},

Roedd ei h\u0175yr 26 oed, Kyle Ellis wedi pledio'n ddieuog i gyhuddiad o'i llofruddio ond . fe dderbyniodd yr erlyniad ei ble o gyflawni dynladdiad.  ar y sail nad oedd yn ei iawn bwyll. Clywodd Llys Y Goron Yr Wyddgrug ei fod wedi cael sawl asesiad gan ddau seiciatrydd ymgynghorol ac wedi cael diagnosis o sgitsoffrenia paranoiaidd. Roedd Ellis, a ymddangosodd yn y llys drwy gyswllt fideo, wedi byw gyda'i nain - a'i daid a fu farw yn 2020 - am o gwmpas 10 mlynedd. Clywodd y rheithgor ei fod wedi curo, tagu a thrywanu Mrs Hannaby yn ei chartref yn Ffordd New Hall, cyn cynnau'r t\u00e2n. Mewn datganiad a gafodd ei ddarllen i'r llys, dywedodd mam y diffynnydd, Sharon Ellis, ei bod wedi caru ei mam yn fawr iawn a'i bod \"yn falch bod Kyle yn cael y driniaeth y mae ei angen\". \"Rydym yn siarad,\" fe ychwanegodd, \"ac mae hynny'n rhoi rhywfaint o gysur i mi.\". Yn ei datganiad hithau, dywedodd wyres Mrs Hannaby, Stephanie Parry, bod clirio t\u0177 ei nain wedi achosi \"hunllefau\", a'i bod \"yn cael trafferth edrych ar, na dal cyllell heb feddwl be aeth nain drwyddo\". Roedd yr ymosodiad ar Mrs Hannaby, meddai'r Barnwr Rhys Rowlands, wedi bod yn un \"hir a milain\". Ond dywedodd bod hi'n glir na fyddai Ellis wedi cyflawni'r \"drosedd ofnadwy\" yma oni bai am ei salwch meddwl ar y pryd, oedd heb ei gadarnhau \"heb s\u00f4n am gael ei drin\". . Dywedodd bod Ellis wedi \"ei faldodi'n llwyr\" ar \u00f4l mynd i fyw gyda'i nain a'i daid yn 14 oed.  . Roedd ei nain, oedd \u00e2 phroblemau iechyd ei hun, wedi dibynnu arno fwyfwy wedi marwolaeth ei daid, ac roedd yna \"straen ar brydiau\" ar eu perthynas. Roedd Ellis wedi cymryd cyfnod o'r gwaith am ei fod dan straen ac roedd ei berthynas \u00e2'i gariad wedi dod i ben. . Yn y dyddiau cyn yr ymosodiad, roedd ei ymddygiad wedi dechrau dod yn destun pryder i'w ffrindiau a pherthnasau. . Anfonodd negeseuon testun a wnaeth beri gofid, gan honni iddo ddioddef camdriniaeth pan yn blentyn.  . Wrth ddedfrydu, dywedodd y Barnwr bod yna ddim cymhelliad i'r farwolaeth, ac mai'r \"seicosis oedd y rheswm\". Gan osod gorchymyn ysbyty am gyfnod amhenodol, dywedodd wrth Ellis mai mater i'r Ysgrifennydd Gwladol a'r Weinyddiaeth Gyfiawnder fydd penderfynu pa bryd y dylid ei ryddhau.

Yn \u00f4l Peter Doran, o Theatr y Torch yn Aberdaugleddau, bydd hi'n cymryd \"llawer o waith\" i ddenu'r cynulleidfaoedd sydd wedi gadael y theatr yn sgil y pandemig. Dywed Llywodraeth Cymru eu bod yn \"ymwybodol o'r heriau\" a bod Cyngor y Celfyddydau yn trafod y mater yn \"rheolaidd\" gyda'r sector. . Ychwanegodd llefarydd bod y sector wedi cael cefnogaeth \"buddsoddiad digynsail\" o \u00a3108m yn ystod y pandemig, a bod hynny wedi helpu i ddiogelu 2,700 o swyddi ledled Cymru. Er gwaethaf ei bryderon, mae Mr Doran yn dweud bod Theatr y Torch wedi bod yn fagwrfa allweddol bwysig i awduron newydd fel Owen Thomas, oedd yn gyfrifol am y dram\u00e2u Grav a Carwyn. \"Os nad oes llefydd fel hyn ar gael, dyw pobl ddim yn cael cyfleon. Fe all pobl ddod yma a gwneud camgymeriadau,\" meddai. Mae Mr Doran, a gafodd ei eni yn nhref Penfro, yn gyfrifol am rai o gynyrchiadau mwyaf llwyddiannus y Torch fel One Flew Over a Cuckoo's Nest a Grav, drama sydd yn dal i gael ei pherfformio, saith mlynedd ar \u00f4l iddi gael ei llwyfannu am y tro cyntaf. . Wrth iddo baratoi i adael ei swydd, mae Mr Doran yn dweud bod Theatr y Torch, sydd yn dathlu ei phen-blwydd yn 45 oed, yn \"allweddol bwysig\" mewn \"ardal sydd wedi gweld llawer o galedi ar hyd y blynyddoedd\". Ond mae'n bryderus am y dyfodol. \"Rwy'n falch nad ydw i yn dechrau mas nawr,\" meddai. \"Rwy'n credu bydd hi'n anodd iawn dros y blynyddoedd nesaf. . \"Mae'r pandemig wedi bod yn anodd iawn i ni. Mae mynd i'r theatr yn arferiad. . \"Chi angen gweld y bobl unwaith y mis, nid dwywaith y flwyddyn. . \"Roedd gyda ni gynulleidfa deyrngar, ond mae'r arferiad wedi cael ei dorri, ac mi fydd hi'n cymryd tipyn o waith i gael y bobl yma n\u00f4l yn rheolaidd.\". Yn \u00f4l Peter Doran, mae diffyg arian yn broblem hefyd. \"Rwy'n teimlo fy mod i wedi bod yn gweithio gydag union yr un faint o arian \u00e2 phan ddechreuais i. . \"Hyd yn oed os ydych chi yn llwyddiannus, does yna ddim gwobr ariannol. . \"Mae yna lawer iawn o dalent yng Nghymru. Ry'n ni yn cynhyrchu pobl ardderchog, ond mae ariannu'r celfyddydau yn anodd.\". Ei gynhyrchiad olaf wrth y llyw yw drama yn seiliedig ar nofel fawr John Steinbeck, Of Mice and Men. . Yn \u00f4l J\u00e2ms Thomas, sy'n chwarae'r brif ran, mae'n \"anrhydedd\" i gael bod yn rhan o ddrama olaf Peter Doran. . \"Pan wnaeth Pete ofyn i fi wneud o'n i'n teimlo bach o bwyse. Mae yna lot o gyfrifoldeb. \"Mae 'da fe'r talent 'ma i gael y gorau mas o bobl trwy gael nhw i ymlacio.\".

Yn \u00f4l Peter Doran, un o'r heriau mawr wrth lwyfannu cynhyrchiad fel Of Mice and Men yw diffyg staff technegol. . \"Mae'n broblem enfawr. Mae'r Coleg Cerdd a Drama yn cynhyrchu staff cefn llwyfan, ond maen nhw i gyd yn mynd i weithio ar gynyrchiadau teledu a ffilm, sydd yn talu yn well. . \"Dyw llwyfannu drama fel hon ddim yn rhwydd bellach, ac mae'n rhaid chwilio am d\u00eem.\". Dywedodd Llywodraeth Cymru ei bod nhw wedi . sefydlu cronfa gwerth \u00a31m.  yn ddiweddar i hyfforddi pobl yn y diwydiannau creadigol. Wrth iddo adael ei swydd, mae Mr Doran yn dweud ei fod yn edrych n\u00f4l gyda balchder ar y cynllun gwerth \u00a36m i drawsnewid Theatr y Torch yn 2008, ac ar gynyrchiadau llwyddiannus. \"Rwy'n meddwl taw One Flew Over a Cuckoo's Nest oedd y cynhyrchiad mwyaf llwyddiannus. Mae pobl yn dal i siarad amdano. . \"Grav sydd wedi para hiraf. Mae'r ddrama wedi bod i Efrog Newydd a Washington, ac ry'n ni mewn trafodaethau i fynd \u00e2 hi i Adeilaide yn Awstralia. Mae hi wedi bod yn siwrne anhygoel.\" . Dywed ei fod e'n teimlo'n ffodus iawn i fod wedi treulio ei yrfa gyfan, fwy neu lai, ym myd y theatr. \"Mae'n rhyfeddol fy mod i wedi treulio 46 o flynyddoedd ym myd y theatr, fel bachgen dosbarth gweithiol o Benfro. Rwy'n gobeithio y gall unrhyw un gyflawni'r un peth.\". Olynydd Peter Doran yn y swydd fydd Chelsey Gillard.

Mae hi'n credu y byddai'r gr\u00een yng nghanol y dref yn lle delfrydol ar gyfer adnoddau o'r fath. Dywedodd cynghorydd lleol bod angen ystyried a oes modd gwireddu syniadau sydd wedi eu hawgrymu gan bobl ifanc lleol. Fe amlinellodd Ms Kirkman yr hyn y mae'n gobeithio amdano yn ystod sesiwn wythnosol y disgyblion yn yr ardd gymunedol. Cafodd yr ardd ei sefydlu, meddai, \"achos mae bywyd wedi mynd yn galed\" ac awydd i \"helpu pobl i gael bwyd am ddim\". \"Dwi isio tyfu pethe yma i bobl gael bwyta trwy'r gaeaf, haf\u2026 beth bynnag,\" ychwanegodd.

Dywedodd Rebecca Evans, y Gweinidog Cyllid a Llywodraeth Leol: \"Mae hwn yn newid sydd wedi ei deilwra i anghenion unigryw'r farchnad dai yng Nghymru ac mae'n cyfrannu at ein gweledigaeth ehangach o greu system drethi decach. . \"Ni fydd 61% o brynwyr tai yn gorfod talu treth. Bydd y newidiadau hyn yn rhoi cymorth i'r bobl sydd ei angen, ac yn helpu ag effaith y cynnydd mewn cyfraddau llog. \"Rydym yn gwybod hefyd y bydd helpu pobl ar ben isaf y farchnad yn helpu'r rhai sy'n prynu am y tro cyntaf, yn enwedig. . \"Rydym yn helpu pobl i brynu eu cartref cyntaf mewn nifer o ffyrdd gwahanol, gan gynnwys perchnogaeth ar y cyd a chynlluniau cymorth i brynu, ac rwy'n falch o allu ymestyn y gefnogaeth honno drwy'r newidiadau hyn i'r Dreth Trafodiadau Tir.\". Wrth ymateb, dywedodd Peter Fox AS ar ran y Ceidwadwyr Cymreig, \"yr wythnos ddiwethaf cymerodd Llywodraeth Geidwadol y DU gamau beiddgar a phendant i roi dyhead, cyfle a thwf wrth galon yr economi. Fel rhan o hynny bydd y Llywodraeth Lafur yn derbyn \u00a370 miliwn yn dilyn newidiadau i dreth stamp yn Lloegr. \"Er bod y toriad treth hwn i brynwyr tai yng Nghymru i'w groesawu - rhywbeth yr ydym wedi bod yn galw amdano ers bron i ddegawd - nid yw'n mynd yn ddigon pell. \"Mae prisiau tai yng Nghymru bellach wedi taro \u00a3240,000, ac eto mae'r Llywodraeth Lafur ym Mae Caerdydd yn cau y drws yn gadarn yn wynebau prynwyr tro cyntaf drwy wrthod rhoi cymorth penodol iddyn nhw.\". Yn y cyfamser, mae Plaid Cymru wedi annog Llywodraeth Cymru i ddefnyddio ei phwerau treth incwm a chadw'r gyfradd sylfaenol ar 20%. Dywedodd Llyr Gruffydd, llefarydd cyllid y blaid: \"Byddai gwneud hyn yn cynnig \u00a3200m y flwyddyn yn ychwanegol i gyllideb Llywodraeth Cymru y gellir ei ddefnyddio'n uniongyrchol i helpu i leddfu pwysau'r argyfwng costau byw, amddiffyn gwasanaethau cyhoeddus a gwarchod y bregus rhag creulondeb y Tor\u00efaid.\". Mae llywodraeth y DU wedi torri'r gyfradd sylfaenol o 20% i 19% - cam a gefnogwyd gan arweinydd Llafur y DU, Syr Keir Starmer. Dywedodd Syr Keir y byddai'r penderfyniad i dorri cyfradd sylfaenol y dreth o 20% i 19% yn \"lleihau'r baich treth ar bobl sy'n gweithio\".", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/cymrufyw/63047477", "related_stories": ["Gwynedd i ymgynghori ar dreth 300% ar ail gartrefi", "'Argyfwng tai': Prynwyr yn llythyru at berchnogion", "Gorymdaith i fynnu ateb i'r 'argyfwng ail gartrefi'", "Ail gartrefi: Gallai treth cyngor rhai gynyddu 300%"], "related_topics": ["Llywodraeth Cymru", "Tai", "Senedd Cymru"]},

Dyna farn aelod o Gymdeithas Owain Glynd\u0175r yngl\u0177n \u00e2 Sycharth, safle plasty Glynd\u0175r yng ngogledd Powys. . Daw'r sylwadau yn dilyn pryder am gyflwr y safle, gyda rhai ymwelwyr yn dweud eu bod wedi dod oddi yno'n ddiweddar yn teimlo'n \"ddigalon\". Mae Sycharth yn heneb restredig, ond mae ar dir preifat, ac yn \u00f4l Cadw - y corff sy'n diogelu safleoedd hanesyddol - y tirfeddianwyr sy'n gyfrifol am gynnal a chadw'r safle. . Bellach mae Sycharth yn rhan o Yst\u00e2d Llangedwyn ac yn eiddo i deulu'r Williams Wynn. Mewn datganiad ddydd Mercher, dywedodd llefarydd ar ran Yst\u00e2d Llangedwyn: \"Ry'n ni mewn cysylltiad \u00e2 Cadw i gytuno ar amserlen ar gyfer gwaith i ddiogelu Sycharth yn y ffordd orau.\". Yn \u00f4l Lloyd James - aelod o bwyllgor rheoli Cymdeithas Owain Glynd\u0175r - byddai'n well pe bai Sycharth dan ofal Llywodraeth Cymru. Dywedodd Mr James: \"Wi'n credu mai dymuniad y Gymdeithas fyddai fod rheolaeth o'r safle yn dod o dan Lywodraeth Cymru, er enghraifft. . \"Dyw hyn ddim yn rhywbeth ry'n ni wedi'i drafod yn y gorffennol felly does gen i ddim penderfyniad ar ran y Gymdeithas, ond wi'n gwybod ei fod yn rhywbeth y bydd swyddogion y Gymdeithas yn ystyried yn ddwys.\". Owain Glynd\u0175r oedd y Cymro olaf i gael ei alw'n Dywysog Cymru. . Roedd Sycharth yn blasty pren ar ben mwnt - roedd adeiladau eraill ar waelod y mwnt, a ffos o dd\u0175r yn ei amgylchynu. . Roedd yn gartref i Glynd\u0175r hyd nes i'r lle gael ei losgi gan filwyr brenin Lloegr ym 1403. Erbyn heddiw, mae'n heneb restredig ac mae Cadw wedi gosod bwrdd gwybodaeth a chodi camfa i hwyluso mynediad at lwybr cyhoeddus sy'n arwain at y mwnt. Fe godwyd pryderon yngl\u0177n \u00e2 chyflwr Sycharth yn ddiweddar ar \u00f4l i aelodau o Gwmni Theatr Maldwyn ymweld \u00e2'r safle. . Mae'r cwmni'n paratoi perfformiad newydd o'r sioe gerdd 'Y Mab Darogan', sydd wedi seilio ar hanes Owain Glynd\u0175r, ac fe aethon nhw i Sycharth fel rhan o'r paratoadau. Dywedodd Penri Roberts, un o gyfarwyddwyr y cwmni: \"Mae 'na faes parcio bach yna, ond dyw e ddim mewn cyflwr gwych ac wedyn mae 'na gamfa yn arwain [at y safle] ond mae'r gamfa wedi torri. . \"Ac wedyn mae'r safle ei hun, wrth ddringo i ben y mwnt, mae'n fl\u00ear ac mae dod lawr o'r mwnt yn gallu bod yn anodd hefyd. . \"Y teimlad cyffredinol ydy nad oes 'na ddim gofal yn cael ei roi i'r lle. \"Ddylai unrhyw un sy'n mynd i Sycharth ddim dod o 'na yn teimlo'n ddigalon, ond dyna'r teimlad oedd gen i a dwi wedi cael o sawl gwaith.\". Yn \u00f4l Bryn Davies, ffermwr lleol sydd wedi arwain sawl taith gerdded i'r safle, mae cyflwr Sycharth yn gwaethygu. \"Mae'n dirywio,\" meddai. \"Does dim ymdrech at ofal na chynnal a chadw. Mae'r mieri a'r draen a'r esgyll a'r dana'l poethion yn tyfu a thyfu.\". Mae Sycharth bellach ar dir fferm ond dywed Bryn Davies nad oes unrhyw gyfrifoldeb am gynnal a chadw ar y ffermwr sy'n denant i Yst\u00e2d Llangedwyn. \"Nid ei gyfrifoldeb o ydy ffensio y darnau pwysig oddi wrth weddill y tir amaeth sydd o gwmpas. Mae hwn yn safle o arwyddoc\u00e2d cenedlaethol.\"  . O dan y Ddeddf Henebion ac Ardaloedd Archeolegol mae gan Weinidogion Cymru'r gallu i gymryd asedau hanesyddol o bwysigrwydd cenedlaethol i'w gwarchodaeth. . Mae yna broses ffurfiol ar gyfer cynnig eiddo i'w hystyried ar gyfer gwarchodaeth. . Dywedodd Lloyd James ei fod o'r farn y byddai pwyllgor Cymdeithas Owain Glynd\u0175r yn gefnogol i wneud cais o'r fath yn achos Sycharth. Mae Penri Roberts yn bendant y dylai'r safle fod ym mherchnogaeth gyhoeddus. . \"Byddai fo'n llawer iawn gwell pe byddai ni fel cenedl yn berchennog ar safle Sycharth, o dan ofal Cadw,\" meddai, \"ac wedyn byddan nhw'n gallu gwneud gwelliannau heb orfod gofyn i neb arall.\" . Dywedodd llefarydd ar ran Cadw: \"Mae Cadw wastad wedi cydnabod arwyddoc\u00e2d Sycharth, ac wedi darparu grantiau i gefnogi'r perchnogion i wneud gwaith cynnal a chadw. . \"Yn 2010-11 buddsoddodd Cadw'n helaeth yn yr heneb, ynghyd \u00e2 safle mwnt a ffos Owain Glynd\u0175r yng Nglyndyfrdwy, gyda gwaith cyfalaf o dros \u00a3500,000 ar y ddau safle dan berchnogaeth breifat. \"Yn Sycharth, roedd hyn yn cynnwys ffurfioli'r mynediad cyhoeddus presennol i'r safle gydag Yst\u00e2d Llangedwyn, creu'r maes parcio, gosod cyfieithiad a gwarchod y gwrthgloddiau, a oedd wedi'u draenio'n wael ac a oedd wedi'u herydu'n wael gan wartheg.  . \"Er bod yr heneb ei hun yn parhau i fod mewn cyflwr da, rydym yn cydnabod bod angen gwella'r maes parcio a'r llwybrau mynediad erbyn hyn.

Mewn digwyddiad i ddathlu Diwrnod Llaeth Ysgol y Byd, fe ddywedodd Gareth Lloyd bod \"mwy o synnwyr gyda'r plant na rhai o'r bobl sy'n creu'r polis\u00efau\". Yn \u00f4l Mr Lloyd, mae'n amser i gael cyfarfodydd gyda'r bobl sy'n gwneud penderfyniadau, gan fod yna faterion \"uwchben\" lefel y ffermwyr sydd angen eu trafod. Dywedodd Llywodraeth Cymru fod ganddyn nhw ymrwymiad i \"sector amaethyddol a chadwyn fwyd cynaliadwy, llewyrchus a llwyddiannus\". Dywedodd Mr Lloyd: \"Mae'n bwysig iawn cymryd mantais a hyrwyddo amaeth yn gyffredinol, a hefyd yr holl fanteision sydd o yfed llaeth. \"Mae'n bwysig ein bod ni'n ceisio gwneud hynny bob diwrnod o'r flwyddyn, ond pan mae yna ddiwrnod penodol fel hyn heddiw, mae'n hollol bwysig ein bod ni'n cymryd mantais a rhannu'r wybodaeth.\". I wneud hynny mae Undeb Amaethwyr Cymru wedi bod yn ymweld ag ysgolion cynradd ledled y wlad. Yn Ysgol Bro Pedr, Llanbedr Pont Steffan yng Ngheredigion, roedd Elliw Dafydd o fferm Gwarffynnon yn cynnal sesiwn ar gynhyrchu llaeth gyda'r plant. \"Dwi 'di dod yma heddiw i addysgu, gweld beth mae plant yn gwybod am laeth, ond hefyd addysgu ymhellach iddyn nhw gael gwybod o ble yn union mae llaeth yn dod, faint o amser mae ffarmwr yn rhoi fewn i gynhyrchu'r cynnyrch gorau,\" meddai. Gyda chynnydd yn nifer y bobl sy'n defnyddio'r cyfryngau cymdeithasol i gael gwybodaeth, mae'n dweud bod cyfleoedd fel hyn i ledaenu'r neges yn hollbwysig. \"Mae gymaint o ffeithiau gwahanol yn cael eu taflu ar hyd y lle, felly mae'n bwysig iawn i fi ddweud wrth bawb am ein llaeth penodol ni hefyd, achos mae hynny yn adlewyrchu ffermydd ar hyd Cymru. \"Yn aml iawn mae ffeithiau am y byd yn cymylu'r hyn sy'n digwydd yng Nghymru, ond ma' ansawdd y llaeth sydd gyda ni yng Nghymru a'r buddion i blant a phobl ifanc a phawb yn anhygoel.\". Wrth flasu llaeth fferm Gwarffynnon, dywedodd Ifan, disgybl blwyddyn 6 yn Ysgol Bro Pedr, mai dyma oedd llaeth \"neisiaf y byd.\". \"Os wyt ti'n gofyn i mam neu dad, fyddan nhw'n dweud bo fi'n caru llaeth,\" meddai. . \"Dwi 'di dysgu lot, fel o ble mae llaeth yn dod a pa . machines.  maen nhw'n . use. i. o. ,\" ychwanegodd Tia, disgybl arall. Yn dod o gefndir ffermio, dywedodd Harri ei bod hi'n bwysig bod ei gyd-ddisgyblion yn deall y broses o gynhyrchu llaeth. \"Os chi ddim yn byw ar fferm, dy'ch chi ddim yn deall dim am fel ry'ch chi'n cael y llaeth,\" meddai. Wrth drafod pwysigrwydd y diwydiant llaeth i economi Cymru, dywedodd Mr Lloyd: \"Ry'n ni'n siarad am laeth fel cynnyrch craidd ond mae'n rhaid i ni gofio am bopeth mae llaeth yn mynd ymlaen i gynhyrchu - caws, iogwrt, ysgytlaeth ac yn y blaen.\". Gyda chynaladwyedd yn flaenoriaeth i lunwyr polisi, mae Mr Lloyd am bwysleisio bod y sector laeth yn rhan o'r ateb. \"Yn anffodus, dwi'n credu bod mwy o synnwyr gyda'r plant yma na rhai o'r bobl sy'n creu'r polis\u00efau,\" meddai. \"Beth sydd angen yw cael cyfarfodydd gyda'r bobl sy'n gwneud penderfyniadau, achos mae'n rhwydd iawn i ddweud bod angen i ni dorri lawr ar ein h\u00f4l carbon ac yn y blaen, ond wedyn ar yr un pryd, does dim problem yn symud cynnyrch o wledydd eraill mewn ac allan. \"Ry'n ni'n cynhyrchu cynnyrch o'r radd orau yn ein gwlad ni ein hunain.

B' e cuideachd a' chiad tachartas m\u00f2r eadar-n\u00e0iseanta a chaidh a chraoladh gu h-eadar-n\u00e0iseanta air an telebhisean.

But flour, she says, is culturally ingrained in our lives. \"I wanted to help people enjoy food culture - and still live long and healthy lives.\". In 2021, she co-founded Hyf\u00e9 Foods. Hyf\u00e9 uses the root network of mushrooms, called mycelium, to make an alternative to wheat flour. \"In addition to the neutral taste, mycelium is high-protein, high-fibre, gluten-free and low carb,\" says Ms Ruiz. Producing mycelium, however, is water-intensive and expensive because of the sugars needed to feed the fungi. . To address this, Hyf\u00e9 uses waste sugar water from food manufacturing. \"Our goal is to scale our technology so that we can achieve price parity, which is why we use upcycled sugar water,\" says Ms Ruiz. \"Up to half of the cost of fermentation can be attributed to sugar, so upcycling can make a meaningful difference to the cost of production.\". Affordable alternatives to wheat are gaining attention, particularly after a year of disruption to the grain market. The war in Ukraine has highlighted our dependence on the wheat harvests that flow from the region.  . Russia and Ukraine together account for nearly a third of global wheat supplies. The war has disrupted that flow of food. In July this year, wheat prices were almost 25% higher than in July 2021. Record high food prices have triggered a global hunger crisis of unprecedented proportions. According to the World Food Programme, the number of people facing acute food insecurity has more than doubled in just two years, from 135 million in 53 countries to 345 million in 82 countries today. On top of that, we are starting to see the impact of climate change. Crops are suffering under the effects of extreme weather. A 2021 report from Chatham House warns that unless we drastically reduce global emissions, by 2050 staple crop yields could decline by nearly a third. . Harvard University scientists say even if we do manage to limit global warming to 2C, as set out by the Paris Agreement, 60% of the world's wheat production will be under threat by the end of the century. \"Even before Ukraine, we had a broken system,\" says Shailaja Fennell, development economist at Cambridge University and founding member of the Forgotten Crops Society. \"While we produced more than enough food, the cost of that food to the environment is already a major concern.\". Prof Fennell warns that monoculture farming - growing one crop species in a field at a time - is not sustainable. . \"[Monoculture crops] are much more susceptible to climate shocks, diseases and drought. Having a more diversified agriculture is the way forward.\". To combat food insecurity some countries, including China and Egypt, are ramping up domestic wheat production. Wheat is even being planted in the Egyptian desert. Instead of trying to grow more wheat, Prof Fennell suggests we look to other cereals, ones that have been forgotten by the global supply chain. . \"There is a whole group of cereals called millets - small-seeded grasses similar to oats and barley - that are more hardy, use less water and are gluten-free,\" she says. . Such alternatives, says Prof Fennell, can have nutritional benefits over wheat and would be of huge interest to the pasta industry. More technology of business:. Pasta is a staple food for millions of people worldwide. It is easy to store when dried, simple to prepare and economical. . According to the International Pasta Organisation almost 17 million tonnes of pasta was produced in 2021 - more than double the amount produced 20 years ago. Durum wheat, from which pasta is typically made, is high yielding and provides about 20% of all calories consumed by humans. In fact, about two-thirds of our daily calories come from just three crops - wheat, rice and maize. . By 2050, the global population is predicted to rise to nearly 10 billion, putting extreme strain on our planet's resources. So since there are about 50,000 edible plant species, perhaps it is time to explore our options. In London's Covent Garden families, friends and lovers dine on pasta under dimmed lights, while Italian classical music plays in the background. But this is not a standard Italian restaurant, and it does not just sell standard pasta. In 2017, Alberto Cartasegna opened his first restaurant, Miscusi, in Milan. He wanted to offer authentic Italian pasta, while having a positive impact on the planet. Five years later and Miscusi now has 15 restaurants in Italy and two in the UK, and has launched its \"M7 pasta\" - a blend of four grains and three legumes - in a bid to promote biodiversity. \"Biodiversity is killed when we approach agriculture with conventional methods like monocropping,\" says Mr Cartasegna. . \"M7 is made of seven different types of grains and legumes, giving our pasta a unique flavour, texture and colour. It's rich in plant-based proteins thanks to the three legumes. All the cereals are organic and wholegrain, keeping fibres and micronutrients to the max. . \"I strongly believe we must change the global diet to save ourselves.\". Los Angeles mother-of-two Gail Becker has also been promoting wheat alternatives. She became frustrated when she could not find healthy alternatives for her sons, who both suffer from coeliac disease, an autoimmune disorder triggered by eating foods containing gluten. \"I tried desperately to find nutritious, gluten-free options that weren't filled with fat, sugar, salt and calories,\" says Ms Becker. \"I stumbled upon recipes for cauliflower crust pizza. . \"My creation tasted fine, but it looked awful, my kitchen was a disaster and I had spent 90 minutes I didn't have, as a mum with a full-time job, making a pizza crust! I realised I probably wasn't alone. So I left my job to strike out on my own and create Caulipower.\". Caulipower, established in 2016, has since expanded beyond pizza crusts to offer frozen cauliflower pastas. Its products can now be found in more than 25,000 stores across the US. \"Consumers want nutritional food,\" says Ms Becker. \"They no longer expect to have to choose between taste and health, and frankly they shouldn't have to.\". Back in Chicago, Hyf\u00e9 is busy cultivating mycelium and turning it into carbon-neutral, healthy, affordable pasta. \"We're creating a new staple crop,\" says Ms Ruiz. \"One that can be grown nearly anywhere in the world, giving countries increased food sovereignty, and employing circular technology for a more resilient food system. \"Our pasta is not just better for you, it's better for the planet.\".", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62646817", "related_stories": [], "related_topics": ["Food allergies", "Diet & nutrition", "Food industry"]},

The relaxation of software controls will allow American tech firms to expand their business in Iran. At least 35 people have been killed in the worst unrest in Iran for years. Mahsa Amini, 22, fell into a coma last week, hours after morality police arrested her for allegedly breaking headscarf rules. . Officers reportedly beat Ms Amini's head with a baton and banged her head against one of their vehicles. The police have said there is no evidence of any mistreatment and that she suffered \"sudden heart failure\". Anti-government protests continued for an eight straight night on Friday, while pro-regime rallies also took place in Tehran and other cities. . Mr Blinken said . the partial relaxation of internet restrictions.  was a \"concrete step to provide meaningful support to Iranians demanding that their basic rights be respected\". It was clear, he added, that the Iranian government was \"afraid of its own people\". The US treasury said the move would help counter the Iranian government's attempt to \"surveil and censor\" its people. But it is unlikely to have an immediate impact as it \"does not remove every tool of communications repression\". Billionaire Elon Musk . said on Twitter.  that he would activate his satellite internet firm, Starlink, to provide internet services to Iran in response to Mr Blinken's announcement. Starlink provides internet services via a huge network of satellites and is aimed at people who live in remote areas who cannot get high-speed internet. US officials said that the updated license did not cover hardware supplied by Mr Musk but his firm and others were welcome to apply for permission to the treasury. Footage shared on social media on Friday showed large crowds of protesters gather in several Tehran neighbourhoods after dark, while other incidents occurred elsewhere the country. In the protests women have defiantly taken off their hijabs and burned them, or cut off their hair in front of cheering crowds. . While spreading across much of the country, many of the early protests were concentrated in western Iran, particularly areas with large Kurdish populations, the group Ms Amini belonged to.  . On Friday, reports emerged from Oshnavieh, in Iran's West Azerbaijan Province, which borders Kurdistan, showing widespread protests, as well as suggestions demonstrators had taken control of large parts of the city. The BBC was unable to confirm this. . Videos posted from Oshnavieh showed large crowds of people marching through city streets with no police presence, while loud explosions could be heard. . Friday also saw pro-regime demonstrations in Tehran and other cities, with those present declaring support for Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has been a target of anti-government protesters. . President Ebrahim Raisi spoke at a pro-government event, saying he would not allow the country's security to be \"threatened\". . \"We will not allow people's security to be put at risk under any circumstances,\" he said, shortly after returning from the United Nations General Assembly in New York. .

Anger has circulated online after over a week of protests sparked by the . death of a Kurdish woman.  in police custody. Internet monitoring group NetBlocks said Instagram and WhatsApp - two of the major communication tools that Iran usually allows - had been restricted. WhatsApp said it was working to keep Iranian users connected. The two Meta-owned apps have millions of Iranian users and have become increasingly popular after authorities blocked other platforms in recent years, including Facebook and Twitter. Telegram, YouTube and TikTok have also periodically been closed down. The latest intermittent blackouts follow the . eruption of nationwide protests.  over Mahsa Amini's death. The 22-year-old had been detained for allegedly failing to adhere to hijab (headscarf) rules. . NetBlocks reported that the internet was partially reconnected on Thursday night but that on Friday it was suffering a \"nation-scale loss of connectivity\" again. . \"People in Iran are being cut off from online apps and services,\" Instagram chief Adam Mosseri tweeted, adding that \"we hope their right to be online will be reinstated quickly\". But others accused Meta of being complicit in disconnecting users. Meta has a team of Persian-speaking reviewers who look at and remove content that violates their rules. If a post that has broken Meta's . community standards.  has been reported by users or flagged by technology, it will be taken down. Some shared their evidence that content supporting the Iranian protests had been blocked by Meta. . People also reported not being able to access their WhatsApp accounts even when trying to use a VPN and proxy. Ordinarily, website access is heavily restricted by government filters and only those with VPNs can access uncensored content from overseas websites. But this ban seems different. . So what is really going on?. The internet blackouts largely come from Iran's biggest mobile phone operator being offline. Iran Mobile Communications Company has more than 60 million customers. Earlier in the week, the communications minister blamed security reasons for the disruption. But Isik Mater from NetBlocks . told the BBC. : \"The internet is one of the biggest tools that the Iranian authorities have got in their hands when unrest breaks out on the streets.\". She says because there is no private broadcast network in Iran, the internet is the \"only place\" where protesters can share their voice. Miss Amini's death has unleashed anger over issues including personal freedoms and economic challenges in Iran. . Protesters - many of whom are women who have been waving and burning their veils - say they fear an escalating crackdown. . \"We are worried that the world will forget about Iran as soon as the regime shuts down the internet - which is already happening,\" one activist, who wanted to remain anonymous, said. . Most of the protests and campaigns are organised by people over social media and if they cannot get connected then it becomes much more difficult to mobilise. . Shayan Sardarizadeh from the BBC's disinformation unit said: \"Shutting down internet connections nationwide is the nuclear option for Iranian authorities, only triggered when they fear protests are on a scale that pose an existential threat to the regime. \"It is an effective tool that severely harms the ability of protesters to organise, communicate and inform the outside world, but it also carries a huge cost for the Iranian economy, businesses and public services. \"However, Iranian authorities have shown time and again that when faced with a choice between a severe hit to the economy and cracking down on political unrest at any cost, they will always choose the latter.\". Clamping down heavily on protesters and internet blackouts has worked to suppress people in Iran in the past. . But fears are growing that the situation could escalate to something . like 2019 protests that erupted.  over petrol price rises, the bloodiest in the Islamic republic's history. . During those protests, the internet was cut off for days at a time. . Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi has said protesting is allowed in the country but \"rioting\" will not be tolerated. \"Protests have always happened in Iran. The protesters are heard. However, protests must be distinguished from rioting,\" he said.

In an exclusive interview with the BBC, Mr Cook said technology \"will not achieve nearly what it could achieve\" without a more diverse workforce. He said there were \"no good excuses\" for the lack of women in the sector. He also said he thought Augmented Reality (AR), and the concept of the Metaverse, were \"profound.\". \"In the future people will wonder how we lived without AR,\" he says. \"We're investing a tonne in that space.\" . Augmented Reality is a mixture of digital content and the real world - a very simple example might be using the phone on your camera to insert virtual furniture before you buy it, to see how it might look in your house. The metaverse is the concept of . entire virtual worlds.  - and big tech is investing heavily in it, not least Meta, formerly Facebook, which re-branded itself to reflect its new priority. I met Tim Cook during his first visit to the UK since the pandemic. . In person, the boss of the world's richest company is affable, polite and thoughtful. . He's softly spoken, and was dressed in his trademark dark clothes. He wasn't big on small talk, although we joked about the British weather, and he offered his condolences on the death of the Queen. . Mr Cook told me he is \"not a great role model\" for work-life balance and that it isn't a phrase he associates with himself. . \"There's little distinction between personal and work, they blend,\" he says.He adds that he tries to \"compartmentalise\" issues that are outside of his control. \"I realise that they're there\u2026 but I don't obsess with it,\" he says. He was fascinated by my BBC audio recorder and turned it over in his hands a few times once we had finished our interview. I confessed that I'd had to ask his colleagues if I could borrow some wired headphones to plug into it - Apple largely ditched the headphone socket from its iPhones in 2016, in favour of wireless in-ear AirPods. \"Oh we still sell those,\" he said seriously of the wired pair hanging from my ears. \"People still buy them.\" . He was keen to talk to me about another subject close to his heart - diversity. Apple has just launched its founders' development programme for female founders and app creators in the UK. \"I think the the essence of technology and its effect on humanity depends upon women being at the table,\" Mr Cook says. \"Technology's a great thing that will accomplish many things, but unless you have diverse views at the table that are working on it, you don't wind up with great solutions.\". He said while companies including his own had made progress on diversity, there were \"no good excuses\" for the tech sector not to employ more women. Apple had 35% female staff across its global staff in 2021, according to its own diversity figures. It launched its original Apple Health Kit in 2014 without a period tracker - which led to accusations that this was an oversight due to male bias among its developers. Deloitte Global . estimate.  large global technology firms will reach nearly 33% overall female representation in their workforces in 2022 on average - with 25% occupying technical roles. One challenge facing the sector is the lack of girls choosing to pursue science, tech, engineering and maths subjects at school. \"Businesses can't cop out and say 'there's not enough women taking computer science - therefore I can't hire enough',\" says Mr Cook. \"We have to fundamentally change the number of people that are taking computer science and programming.\". His view is that everybody should be required to take some sort of coding course by the time they finish school, in order to have a \"working knowledge\" of how coding works and how apps are created. . Apple has also created its own programme language, Swift, along with content for learning how to use it. . Mr Cook and I also met a small group of female app founders, three of whom have joined Apple's new programme. One of those is Alexia de Broglie, who created a personal finance education app called Your Juno, for women and non-binary people, after being shocked by how little her female friends understood about finance. She said she belongs to some WhatsApp groups for founders, and that some of those are 90% male. \"[The women] all know each other on a first-name basis, which is crazy, because there are so many men that are building start-ups, and they definitely don't know each other.\". Ariana Alexander-Sefre runs Spoke, a wellness app aimed at young people, which she created after her younger brother lost a friend to suicide. \"I hope that in five years, that there's not even going be a thing of female founder, or there's not even going to be a defined niche because, you know, there will just be so many different people working on different things,\" she says. \"I'd love to see the whole playing field just equalised.\".", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-63033078", "related_stories": ["Testing the new iPhone: From battery to always-on screen", "What if there were more women in tech?", "The black women in tech coding the future"], "related_topics": ["Women", "Tim Cook", "Apple", "iPhones"]},

The company makes most of its phones in China but has shifted some production outside the country as tensions rise between Washington and Beijing. China's 'zero-Covid' policies, that have triggered widespread lockdowns, have also caused major disruptions for businesses during the pandemic. The technology giant . unveiled its latest iPhone earlier this month. . \"The new iPhone 14 line-up introduces groundbreaking new technologies and important safety capabilities. We're excited to be manufacturing iPhone 14 in India,\" Apple said in a statement. Taiwan-based Foxconn, which manufactures the majority of Apple's phones, has had an operation in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu since 2017, where it makes older versions of the handsets. But now, Apple is betting big to make in India its newest product - the iPhone 14. By betting on India, Apple is also looking to increase its footprint in the country. As of last year, its market share was about 4% there. . The US giant has been struggling to compete with the much cheaper South Korean and Chinese smartphones that continue to dominate the Indian smartphone market. . But manufacturing in India does not mean the phones will be cheaper in the country because of high import duties on components and other taxes. So while Indians might be looking at the 'Made in India' tag on their iPhone they will still have to pay a hefty sum to own it. The announcement that iPhone production has increased in India is a win for prime minister Narendra Modi's administration. . His government launched its flagship \"Make in India\" campaign eight years ago as it aimed to boost the country's manufacturing and exports. Apple's announcement marks its latest move towards diversifying supply chains to avoid disruptions as tensions rise between China and the US over Taiwan and trade. . Earlier this month, analysts at investment bank JP Morgan said that they expect Apple to move around 5% of iPhone production to India this year. . The report also predicted that a quarter of all iPhone production will be in the South Asian nation by 2025. Last year, Apple supplier Foxconn invested $1.5bn (\u00a31.4bn) in Vietnam, according to the South East Asian country's government.

Seen as the most promising next-generation solar cell, this technology, called perovskite, is exactly what Japanese start-up Enecoat Technologies is trying to develop. . When ready, the Kyoto-based firm hopes its product will produce as much power as a regular solar panel of the same size. \"We are hoping to market them in three to four years,\" says the co-founder and chief executive of the company, Naoya Kato. \"But to use them outdoors, we need to make them durable for any kind of weather conditions, so that will take longer.\" . Start-ups such as this are called \"deep tech\". They are small firms who are merging high-tech engineering innovation with scientific discovery. The hope is that it will lead to the development of transformational products. But a successful product launch in this sector takes time. As a result, private venture capital funds that lend money to entrepreneurs may be more cautious to invest in them. . That is where Kyoto University plays a crucial role. It may be . best known for producing more Nobel prize winners than any other university in Asia (11 in total),.  but it also finances new start-ups by students and researchers through its two venture capital funds. Enecoat Technologies is one of the beneficiaries, and has received a total of 500m yen ($3.6m; \u00a33m). The money came from a $300m fund that the university received from the Japanese government back in 2015 to encourage entrepreneurship. \"Kyoto University is strong in very hard science fields like regenerative medicine, stem cell science, and cleantech energy,\" says Koji Murota, who heads the university's Office of Society-Academia Collaboration for Innovation. . \"But in order to commercialise these deep-tech companies it requires a long time and a large amount of money.\". Mr Murota adds that while a typical venture capital fund's investment period may be eight to 10 years, that is not long enough for deep tech, so the university's scheme offers up to 20 years of support. Since Kyoto University started its innovation department and investment fund seven years ago, the number of start-ups created by its students have more than doubled to 242. New Tech Economy.  is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape. That is second only to Tokyo University, which also received similar funding from the government, but Kyoto University's growth rate is much higher. But even before the university started offering support to entrepreneurs, the city of Kyoto was known for producing start-ups. These include Nintendo. It may be a computer game giant today, but when it launched way back in 1889 it made playing cards. Another successful firm set up in Kyoto is tech giant Kyocera, . which was founded in 1959 by the late Kazuo Inamori, one of Japan's best-known business leaders. . A more recent business success story in the city is microchip manufacturer and fellow deep-tech start-up Flosfia. Also backed by the university, it makes semiconductors that specialise in using energy more efficiently, thereby extending the lifespan of the product, such as electric cars. \"Kyoto's uniqueness is being small and yet diverse,\" says Kyoto University graduate and the boss of Flosfia, Toshimi Hitora. \"The university is at the heart of it, and with so many researchers in a small community, anyone can access the information you need to start a business. \"But all the Kyoto-based companies' founders also say that, unlike firms in Tokyo, they don't have enough customers here [in Kyoto], so they had to think globally from the beginning.\". Mr Hitora adds: \"It has been more than 10 years since we started Flosfia because deep tech takes time, and I feel Kyoto people understand that.\". Some 30 years ago, Japan was a pioneer in the semiconductor industry, but today it has less than 10% market share. For Flosfia to establish a significant presence in the highly competitive global semiconductor industry, one dominated by firms such as South Korea's Samsung and Taiwan's TSMC, will be a challenge, especially as China and the US are also trying to put their stamp on the market. In the US this move is being led by the White House, with the House of Representatives passing a government act in July that commits . a $280bn support package for domestic chip production and research.  The US wishes to reduce its dependence on other nations for supplies. But Mr Hitora believes that Japanese producers like his have their own strengths. \"Japan is good at doing basic research, and working with new materials, so I feel we have a big potential,\" he says. He adds that Flosfia now has alliances with most of Taiwan's main chip manufacturers. \"Semiconductors are needed globally, so some governments may try to intervene to ensure the supply for their home markets, but it takes a long time to produce semiconductors,\" says Mr Hitora. \"To mass produce them, we need a lot of stakeholders and a lot of businesses in many countries. That is why I believe our alliances with other companies are important.\". As Japan plays catch-up in the semiconductor sector, Kyoto University's ability to patiently play the long game with firms such as Flosfia increases the hope that the country will be successful. .

Instead, most of the five-storey building has been constructed out of wood. The school won't be completed until next year, although smooth wooden panels already line many of the interior walls. Wood has also been used in load-bearing structures, to support the ceilings between the floors, and as cladding on the exterior. \"It's a more sustainable choice,\" says Miimu Airaksinen, an engineer and vice president of development at SRV, the Finnish construction company behind the school. . \"But we're also working with wood because wood is a nice material, people appreciate and like wood and the design of wood.\". The project is part of a growing trend in the Finnish building industry. Developers are increasingly swapping out more mainstream materials like concrete and steel, in favour of wood. It's linked to the country's ambitious efforts to achieve carbon neutrality by 2035 and become Europe's leading circular economy. With three-quarters of land in Finland covered by forests, wood is a readily available material here, although it does need to be strengthened for use in mid-rise and tall buildings. In Finland, where detached wooden villas and summer cottages are common, there is less public concern about fires than there might be in parts of the world that are less used to using wood as a construction material. . However, SRV still faces questions about flammability, especially in taller buildings. There is plenty of evidence that CLT performs well in fires though, says Ms Airaksinen, since it is designed to withstand high heat levels and can be slower to collapse compared to concrete. At the upper school construction site, Ms Airaksinen's team are busy slicing up slabs of engineered wood called CLT (cross-laminated timber) which is produced by bonding together layers of wooden panels at right angles. \"You're making the wood stiffer, so that makes the wood much stronger,\" she explains. Engineered wood like CLT has a range of environmental benefits, including being much lighter than many building materials, so less heavy machinery and energy is needed during construction. Buildings can also be quicker to complete since there is no drying phase as there is with concrete. . Plus, wooden buildings actually remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than they emit; they can hold in carbon that is absorbed from the atmosphere by trees for five to six decades. By contrast, steel and concrete leave massive carbon footprints. \"It can really help us with climate change,\" says Ali Amiri, a sustainable buildings researcher at Aalto University near Helsinki, and a former civil engineer. \"If we go through the comparison with wooden buildings and other buildings like concrete or steel or even brick buildings, [wood has] something like 20 to even 30% lower greenhouse gas emissions. So this is very good news.\". According to his team's research, if 80% of new residential buildings in Europe were made of wood they could store up to 55 million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year. That is equivalent to almost half the yearly emissions made by the continent's cement industry. Engineered woods like CLT have been used in Europe since the 1990s, but they have had a resurgence in Finland thanks to a government-backed wood-building programme designed to ensure 45% of public buildings use wood as a key material by 2025. Developers can apply for grants and get help with tasks such as procurement and risk communication. \"I think every company [here] is doing wooden buildings today,\" says Ms Airaksinen. \"The pressure is on for sustainability.\". At the upper secondary school, gypsum board, which is made from limestone and not flammable, is used to add an extra layer of protection on the interior walls on higher floors. \"We need to take fire safety seriously,\" says Ms Airaksinen. \"We also did a lot of simulation about evacuation and durability in case there will be a fire.\" . The wooden trend is catching on in the private sector too. Data from the Federation of the Finnish Woodworking Industries suggests it is already a key material in 4% of apartments and 16% of commercial buildings. . In Helsinki city centre there's even a new neighbourhood, Wood City, with hundreds of new wooden flats. It is also home to the headquarters of Finnish gaming giant Supercell, where huge carved wooden characters and dramatic curved panels make for an impactful reception area, and wood lines the walls of eight storeys of open-plan office space, cafes and even nap rooms. Cybersecurity company WithSecure is in the process of building a new office next door, in collaboration with SRV and Stora Enso, a major Finnish producer of engineered wood. And, perhaps least surprisingly, in a country where people famously love getting sweaty, one of Helsinki's most popular leisure attractions is a giant wooden sauna and restaurant complex. Opened in 2016, the L\u00f6yly complex has won multiple global awards for its striking wooden cloak-like structure, which allows visitors to climb up its sloping roof. Environmental campaign groups such as WWF have raised concerns that increasing the construction of wooden buildings could put too much pressure on the planet's forests. . \"From a climate perspective it is a good way to store carbon, but on the other hand we are increasing the overall level of consumption of natural resources,\" says Mai Suominen, a leading forest expert for WWF. \"Because obviously we do need other wood-based products as well, such as paper or packing material, [and] if we plan to increase other production, we are increasing the level of cutting.\". Finland's wood production companies have committed to replanting logged areas in a sensitive and sustainable way. However, Ms Suominen argues that there is still a risk of lower biodiversity if production ramps up in future, which could have an impact on both animals and humans. \"Then the forest processes, at some point they collapse and they are not as flexible to responding to changing environmental conditions caused by climate change. We will face more rainfall, more drought and insect outbreaks.\". Sustainability expert Nani Pajunen from the Finnish Innovation Fund, Sitra, agrees it is important that construction firms in Finland and beyond don't simply jump on the bandwagon of the wooden buildings trend in an effort to appear greener. . She argues it is more important that businesses make broad assessments of the carbon footprint of their production processes, and the different life cycle potentials of materials. For example, other recent innovations designed to improve sustainability in the sector, such as recyclable concrete and steel, might be more durable than wood in large-scale projects such as very tall apartment blocks, public venues or bridges. . \"It's not a black and white question of which [materials] are wrong and right,\" she argues. \"It's about the attitude. You have to think, if you are an engineer in the construction sector, how to use materials in a more sustainable way.\". Despite the environmental concerns, the wooden buildings sector is growing, with other Nordic countries, Germany, Canada and the US in particular ramping up their production in the last couple of years. Market research company Fortune Business Insights recently valued the CLT market at $806m (\u00a3715m) and predicted growth of 14% by 2028. . In the wake of the Ukraine war pushing up the global cost of steel and energy, Mr Amiri says his research team has also noticed a spike in enquiries from businesses and decision-makers from around the world. . While Mr Amiri predicts wooden building construction will \"definitely increase\" in Europe and North America in the coming years, he points out that building with engineered wood for multi-storey projects is still \"a bit more expensive\" than using more common materials. This, he argues, might make it harder to persuade countries with access to cheap concrete and steel to switch direction. . Back amongst the forklift trucks and diggers continuing to transform SRV's school construction site, Ms Airaksinen says she envisages the wooden building sector increasing in tandem with the development of new low-carbon materials. . \"We are focusing on building sustainable buildings and lifecycle wise buildings,\" she says. \"That's the future.\".", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62798950", "related_stories": ["Helsinki's new building held up by trees"], "related_topics": ["Recycling", "Construction industry", "Climate change", "Environment", "Finland"]},

The UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) found the video-sharing platform may have processed the data of under-13s without appropriate consent. The watchdog said the breach happened over more than two years - until July 2020 - but that it had not yet drawn final conclusions. TikTok says it disputes the findings, noting that they are \"provisional\". . The ICO has issued TikTok Inc and TikTok Information Technologies UK Limited with a \"notice of intent\" - a legal document which precedes a potential fine. .

TikTok has rolled out a number of features to strengthen the privacy and safety on the site - including allowing parents to link their accounts to their children's, and disabling direct messaging for under-16s. But Mr Edwards continued: \"I've been clear that our work to better protect children online involves working with organisations, but will also involve enforcement action where necessary. \"In addition to this, we are currently looking into how over 50 different online services are conforming with the Children's Code, and have six ongoing investigations looking into companies providing digital services who haven't, in our initial view, taken their responsibilities around child safety seriously enough.\". Rolled out in September last year, the Children's Code put in place new data protection codes of practice for online services likely to be accessed by children, built on existing data protection laws, with financial penalties a possibility for serious breaches. The ICO said its findings in the notice were provisional, with no conclusion to be drawn at this stage that there had been any breach of data protection law. It added: \"We will carefully consider any representations from TikTok before taking a final decision.\". A TikTok spokesperson said: \"This notice of intent, covering the period May 2018-July 2020, is provisional and as the ICO itself has stated, no final conclusions can be drawn at this time. \"While we respect the ICO's role in safeguarding privacy in the UK, we disagree with the preliminary views expressed and intend to formally respond to the ICO in due course.\" .

Based in Helsinki, Finland, it will be led by former Zynga and Electronic Arts executive Marko Lastikka. Netflix has previously purchased small gaming companies, such as Oxenfree developer Night School Studio. But the streaming giant is now going further and creating a studio from scratch. . Lastikka is an established figure in gaming, having co-founded Zynga studio - also in Helsinki - which worked on FarmVille 3 under his leadership. . Amir Rahimi, Netflix VP of Game Studios, announced the \"vision to build a world-class games studio\" . in a blog post. . \"[It] will bring a variety of delightful and deeply engaging original games, with no ads and no in-app purchases.\". In April, Netflix announced a loss of 200,000 subscribers, it first quarterly loss since 2011. Its share price dropped by 35%, wiping more than $50bn (\u00a346.5bn) off the firm's market value. Netflix then lost almost a million subscribers between April and July 2022, the biggest in its history, though it still has more than 220m subscribers worldwide. Netflix purchased Helsinki-based Next Games in March 2022. It already had a working relationship with the game developer, which made a mobile game based on the Netflix hit series, Stranger Things. At the time, Next Games was described as \"a core studio in a strategic region and key talent market\", by Netflix VP of Games Michael Verdu. Gaming researcher Annakaisa Kultima, who lives in Helsinki, told the BBC that this acquisition would have played a part in Netflix's decision. \"They know how Helsinki works,\" she said, \"and how the development culture works in Finland. . \"There are hundreds of games published on a daily basis on the app stores, so in order to really make it there, you have to have the critical knowledge of how to make it happen. . \"We have the reputation of doing pretty well for the past decade or two in the game industry, but games are not labelled where they were made. . \"From that perspective, I think that's the reason, they know that talent is based in Finland - [Clash of Clans developer] Supercell is in Helsinki in the city centre, and [Angry Birds developer] Rovio Entertainment and [Control developer] Remedy Entertainment are in Espoo, which borders the city.\". Netflix has had a growing interest in the gaming industry in recent years. It has released several series based on games, such as Arcane (based on League of Legends) and Cyberpunk: Edgerunners (based on Cyberpunk: 2077). Netflix is also working closely with Ubisoft, which will see both a live-action Assassin's Creed television series developed, and a Netflix-exclusive mobile game. It is unclear whether the Netflix studio intends to develop games exclusively for mobile, or if it will also target the home console market. Eric Seufert, an independent industry analyst, said he thought Netflix is making \"pretty substantial investments\" into the gaming industry. . \"If they want to utilise a lot of the IP that they have, they probably have to build a lot of those games themselves,\" he said, \"because working with external publishers on IP licencing deals becomes very tedious and complex. . \"They have so much data on customer preferences on the video-streaming content side, my sense is they can probably bring some of that to bear. \"I think ultimately what they want to do is utilise these games as part of the product content package, and then funnel into the Netflix universe.\".", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-63048019", "related_stories": ["Why some viewers are switching off Netflix", "Netflix and Microsoft team up for cheaper service", "Have we had enough of Netflix?"], "related_topics": ["Gaming", "Netflix"]},

The NHS said 448,000 people had used it to make organ-donation decisions between September 2021 and August 2022. This is a 69% increase on the previous 12 months, which saw 265,000 people registering their decision through the app. The number of app downloads is now equivalent to more than half the population of England.

Some experts say it may be the worst data breach in Australia's history. But this week has seen more dramatic and messy developments - including ransom threats, tense public exchanges and scrutiny over whether this constituted a \"hack\" at all. It's also ignited critical questions about how Australia handles data and privacy. Optus - a subsidiary of Singapore Telecommunications Ltd - went public with the breach about 24 hours after it noticed suspicious activity on its network. Australia's second biggest telecoms provider said current and former customers' data was stolen - including names, birthdates, home addresses, phone and email contacts, and passport and driving licence numbers. It stressed that payment details and account passwords were not compromised. Those whose passport or licence numbers were taken - roughly 2.8 million people - are at a \"quite significant\" risk of identity theft and fraud, the government has since said. Optus said it was investigating the breach and had notified police, financial institutions, and government regulators. The breach appears to have originated overseas, local media reported. . In an emotional apology, Optus chief executive Kelly Bayer Rosmarin called it a \"sophisticated attack\", saying the company has very strong cybersecurity. \"Obviously, I am angry that there are people out there that want to do this to our customers, and I'm disappointed that we couldn't have prevented it,\" she said on Friday. . Early on Saturday, an internet user published data samples on an online forum and demanded a ransom of $1m (A$1.5m; \u00a3938,000) in cryptocurrency from Optus. The company had a week to pay or the other stolen data would be sold off in batches, the person said. Investigators are yet to verify the user's claims, but some experts quickly said the sample data - which contained about 100 records - appeared legitimate. Sydney-based tech reporter Jeremy Kirk contacted the purported hacker and said the person gave him a detailed explanation of how they stole the data. The user contradicted Optus's claims the breach was \"sophisticated\", saying they puled the data from a freely accessible software interface. \"No authenticate needed\u2026 All open to internet for any one to use,\" they said in a message, according to Kirk. In another escalation on Tuesday, the person claiming to be the hacker released 10,000 customer records and reiterated the ransom deadline. But just hours later, the user apologised - saying it had been a \"mistake\" - and deleted the previously posted data sets. \"Too many eyes. We will not sale [sic] data to anyone,\" they posted. \"Deepest apology to Optus for this. Hope all goes well from this.\". That sparked speculation about whether Optus had paid the ransom - which the company denies - or whether the user had been spooked by the police investigation. Adding to the problem, others on the forum had copied the now-deleted data sets, and continued to distribute them. It also emerged some customers' Medicare details - government identification numbers that could provide access to medical records - had also been stolen, something Optus did not previously disclose. . Late on Wednesday, the company said this had affected almost 37,000 Medicare cards.  . Optus has been inundated with messages from angry customers since last week. . People have been warned to watch out for signs of identity theft and for opportunistic scammers, who are said to be already cashing in on the confusion. . A class-action lawsuit could soon be filed against the company. \"This is potentially the most serious privacy breach in Australian history, both in terms of the number of affected people and the nature of the information disclosed,\" said Ben Zocco from Slater and Gordon Lawyers. The government has called the breach \"unprecedented\" and blamed Optus, saying it \"effectively left the window open\" for sensitive data to be stolen. In an ABC television interview on Monday, Cyber Security Minister Clare O'Neil was asked: \"You certainly don't seem to be buying the line from Optus that this was a sophisticated attack?\". \"Well, it wasn't. So no,\" Ms O'Neil replied. The moment drew lots of attention online. . Ms Bayer Rosmarin told News Corp Australia on Tuesday: \"We have multiple layers of protection. So it is not the case of having some sort of completely exposed APIs [software interfaces] sitting out there. \"I think most customers understand that we are not the villains,\" she said, adding Optus could not say more while the investigation was ongoing. The company has faced calls to cover the costs of replacement passport and driving licences, as people scramble to protect themselves. The breach highlights how much Australia lags other parts of the world on privacy and cyber issues, Ms O'Neil says. \"We are probably a decade behind\u2026 where we ought to be,\" she told the ABC. Both sides of politics have traded blame on the issue. Opposition MPs have said the Labor government is \"asleep at the wheel\", but the government points out it was only elected in May after a decade of conservative rule. Ms O'Neil pointed to two areas needing urgent reform. She argues the government should be able to better penalise companies like Optus. In some countries, the company would have faced hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties but Australia's fine is capped at about $2m, she said. She also wants to expand cyber-security laws that were introduced last year to include telecommunications companies. \"At the time, the telecommunications sector said: \"Don't worry about us - we're really good at cybersecurity. We'll do it without being regulated. I would say that this incident really calls that assertion into question.\". Security experts have also suggested reforming data retention laws so telecommunication companies don't have to keep sensitive information for so long. Ex-customers should also have the right to request companies delete their data, experts say. Optus says it is required to keep identity data for six years under the current rules. Other industry figures have argued consumers should be able to take companies that lose control of their information to court, instead of the industry regulator.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-63056838", "related_stories": ["Could my BeReal get me sacked?", "How your data is being scraped from social media", "Don\u2019t underestimate Russian cyber-threat, warns US", "The three Russian cyber-attacks the West most fears"], "related_topics": ["Data breaches", "Cyber-security", "Australia"]},

Traditionally, spacecraft have struggled to determine the full state of the floes in summer months because the presence of surface meltwater has befuddled their instruments. But by using new \"deep learning\" techniques, scientists have pushed past this limitation to get reliable observations across all seasons. The breakthrough has wide implications. Apart from the obvious advantage to ships, which need to know those parts of the Arctic that will be safe to navigate, there are significant benefits to climate and weather forecasting. . At the moment, there is considerable variation in the projections for when the polar ocean might be totally free of ice in an ever warmer world. Having an improved insight into the melting processes in those key months when floes are being reduced, in area and thickness, ought now to sharpen the output from computer models. \"Despite excellent efforts by many researchers, these climate models' predictions of when we'll see the first fully ice-free Arctic Ocean in summer - they vary by 30-plus years,\" Dr Jack Landy, from UiT The Arctic University of Norway, told BBC News. . \"We need to tighten those predictions so we're a lot more confident about what's going to happen and when - and how the climate feedbacks will accelerate as a consequence.\". The extent of Arctic sea-ice cover has been in decline for the entire period that satellites have been monitoring it, which is more than 40 years - a reduction running at . an average rate of 13% per decade. . But it's only really since 2011 that spacecraft have been able to consistently measure its thickness - and thickness (or more properly, volume) is the true measure of the floes' health. . That's because the extent of sea-ice cover is heavily dependent on whether the winds have spread out the floes or pushed them together. To measure thickness, scientists use satellite altimeters. The European Space Agency's (Esa) pioneering Cryosat-2 mission carries a radar to measure the difference in height between the top of the marine ice and the top of the water in the cracks, or leads, that separate the floes. From this difference, scientists can then, with a relatively simple calculation, work out the thickness of the ice. The approach works well in winter months, but in summer, when the snows on top of the ice, and the ice itself, start to melt, pooling water effectively dazzles the radar. Scientists can't be sure if the echo signal that returns to Cryosat is coming from the open ocean or from the surface of a meltpond sitting on the ice. May through to September - the key melt season - has been a blind period for the spacecraft. To solve the problem, researchers used an artificial intelligence (AI) technique in which an algorithm was able to learn and identify reliable observations from a vast library of synthetic radar signals. Prof Julienne Stroeve, from University College London (UCL), explained: \"We simulated what would be the echo shapes that we would get for different ice surface types - whether they had meltponds; whether it was flooded ice; or ice of different roughnesses; or simply leads. We created this huge database of physically based estimates of what the radar return should look like, and then we matched those to the individual radar pulses from the instrument to find echoes that matched the best.\". Esa has kept in its data archives all the Cryosat May-to-September measurements, even though for the past decade they've been of next to no use. But now, thanks to this new approach, Dr Landy's team has been able to go back through the records to recover full-year ice thickness measurements for the entire time the satellite has been operational. Dr Rachel Tilling worked extensively with Cryosat data before transferring her studies to the US space agency's recently launched Icesat-2 laser altimeter mission. She applauded the innovation. . \"Summer is when sea-ice extent in the Arctic is seeing its most rapid decline, and having this extra dimension will help us understand more about how the ice pack is changing,\" the Nasa scientist told BBC News. \"Icesat-2 has its own unique difficulties in summer but we're lucky that its photon-counting technology means we can still measure the height of sea-ice, water and melt ponds year-round. \"Having said that, Cryosat-2 will always be my first love so I'm really excited to see it being used in this novel way.\". A chief beneficiary of the new thickness measurements would be Inuit populations in the Arctic, said Dr Michel Tsamados, also from UCL. \"[They] have identified sea-ice roughness and slush (melted snow and ice) as a key impediment for safe travel on the ice with the changing climate already negatively affecting these characteristics and causing increased travel accidents and search-and-rescues,\" he explained. . \"Both are related to the thickness of the ice. Therefore, measuring throughout the full year the sea-ice thickness from space from Cryosat-2 but also Icesat-2 and other satellite sensors will eventually help provide better maps to the Inuit populations for safe travel over this rapidly changing terrain.\" .

The image shows a piece of Comet Leonard's tail breaking off and being carried away by the solar wind. The comet made a brief appearance to Earth after being discovered in 2021, but has now left our Solar System. The Royal Observatory Greenwich in London runs the Astronomy Photography of the Year competition and called the image \"astonishing\". It also awarded two 14-year-old boys in Sichuan, China, the prize for Young Astronomy Photographer of the Year. The images are on show in an exhibition at the National Maritime Museum in London from Saturday. \"Comets look different from hour to hour - they are very surprising things,\" explained the winning photographer Gerald Rhemann, from Vienna, Austria. The picture was taken on Christmas Day 2021 from an observatory in Namibia, home to some of the world's darkest skies. He had no idea that the comet's tail would disconnect, leaving the sparkling dust trail in its wake. . \"I was absolutely happy to take the picture - it's the highlight of my photography career,\" he told BBC News. Astronomer Dr Ed Bloomer, who was one of the competition judges, said the image was one of the best comet photographs in history. \"The perfect astrophotograph is the collision of science and arts. Not only is it technically sophisticated and projects the viewer into deep dark space, but also it's visually arresting and emotional,\" Dr Hannah Lyons, assistant curator of art at Royal Museums Greenwich, told BBC News. The judges looked at more than 3,000 entries from around the world. For their winning image, Yang Hanwen and Zhou Zezhen, both 14, worked together to photograph the Andromeda Galaxy, one of the closest and largest neighbours of the Milky Way. The image shows the stunning colours of a galaxy near our own. \"I think this photo shows how gorgeous our nearest neighbour is,\" Yang Hanwen said. The category Young Astronomy Photographer of the Year is for people aged under 16. Dr Lyons said she was \"blown away\" by the quality of the young photographers, \"producing the most remarkable images\". This image by Slovakian photographer Filip Hrebenda shows the Northern Lights reflected on a freezing Icelandic lake above the Eystrahorn mountain. . Peter Szabo was highly commended for Young Astronomy Photographer of the Year for this photograph of the Moon, which he took in Debrecen, Hungary. The image uses high-quality processing to show the Moon's surface in incredible detail, revealing a sight that is familiar to most people but in an extraordinary way. P\u00e9ter Felt\u00f3ti captured this image from Hungary. The IC 1805 is an area of huge amounts of ionised gas and interstellar dust. A strong stellar wind blows the surrounding material outwards, creating a cave-like hollow shape in a gas cloud. . \"It is very difficult to capture dark nebula with any kind of clarity,\" explained Dr Ed Bloomer. Astrophotography was important, he added, because it revealed features of the cosmos that the human eye couldn't see just by looking at the night sky. Weitang Liang took this picture of the Helix Nebula in R\u00edo Hurtado, Chile, at the Chilescope observatory. \"It's easy to see how the ancients used to stargaze into the heavens and imagine that the cosmos was looking back, keeping a watchful eye over us,\" judge Imad Ahmed said. This image by Pauline Woolley, combining pictures taken by large telescopes, won the prize for innovation. It shows how the sun changes over time using the idea of tree-ring dating. Using an ordinary camera, Lun Deng captured this image of Milky Way rising above the Minya Konka Mountain, the highest peak in Sichuan China.

The observatory's infrared instruments highlight features not seen in such detail since the Voyager 2 probe flew past the planet in 1989. These include the rings and dust bands that encircle the ice giant. Scientists are also intrigued by the different cloud structures, which should tell them something novel about the workings of Neptune's atmosphere. . Beyond the planet itself are seven of the giant's 14 moons, the most significant of which is Triton. It appears star-like in the Webb imagery. That's because Neptune is darkened in the telescope's view by methane absorption at infrared wavelengths. Triton, on the other hand, reflects an average of 70% of the sunlight that strikes its icy surface. It's very bright. Prof Leigh Fletcher, from Leicester University, is at the Europlanet Science Congress in Granada, Spain, where everyone is \"trying to interpret this on our phones, but it's incredible to see those rings, and we're accessing wavelengths that no-one has seen before\".  . \"Its great to see how excited everyone is!\" he told BBC News. \"The longer wavelengths are brand new and could give us a window on to the deep circulation patterns, with a bright equatorial band that looks a bit like the bright bands of Jupiter and Saturn. . \"Neptune's powerful storms are as active as ever, and the whole Neptune family is represented here, with those ring moons and Triton.\". Neptune is the outermost planet in our Solar System, beyond Uranus and Saturn, but inside the dwarf planet Pluto. It circles the Sun at a distance of roughly 4.5 billion km, and takes 164.8 years to complete one revolution. . Like the other outer Solar System giants, its atmosphere contains a lot of hydrogen and helium. But there is a very strong presence of ices, of water, ammonia and methane.

Researchers from the . World Weather Attribution.  group say climate change may have increased the intensity of rainfall. However there were many uncertainties in the results, so the team were unable to quantify the scale of the impact. The scientists believe there's roughly a 1% chance of such an event happening in any coming year. . In the two months since . flooding began in Pakistan. , tens of millions of people have been affected, with around 1,500 dying because of the rising waters. . The intensity of the downpours saw the river Indus burst its banks, while landslides and urban flash floods swamped many areas. . Right from the start, politicians pointed to climate change as having made a significant contribution to the desperate scenes. . But this first scientific analysis says the picture is complex. . Certainly, the crippling heatwaves that gripped India and Pakistan earlier this year were easier to attribute, with . researchers finding that climate change had made them up to 30 times more likely to happen. . . But extreme rainfall events are hard to assess. Pakistan is located on the edge of the monsoon region where the rainfall pattern is extremely variable from year to year. Further complications include the impact of large-scale weather events such as La Ni\u00f1a, which also played a role in the last major floods in Pakistan in 2010. During the 60-day period of heaviest rainfall this summer scientists recorded an increase of about 75% over the Indus river basin, while the heaviest five-day period over the provinces of Sindh and Balochistan recorded a rise in rainfall of around 50%. The researchers then used climate models to determine how likely these events would be in a world without warming. . Some of the models indicated that the increases in rainfall intensity could all be down to human-caused climate change - however there were considerable uncertainties in the results. . \"Our evidence suggests that climate change played an important role in the event, although our analysis doesn't allow us to quantify how big the role was,\" said Friederike Otto from Imperial College London, one of the report's authors. \"What we saw in Pakistan is exactly what climate projections have been predicting for years. It's also in line with historical records showing that heavy rainfall has dramatically increased in the region since humans started emitting large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. And our own analysis also shows clearly that further warming will make these heavy rainfall episodes even more intense.\". \"So while it is hard to put a precise figure to the contribution of climate change, the fingerprints of global warming are evident.\". The researchers say that the heavy rainfall that Pakistan endured this year now has around a 1% chance of recurring in any given year, although this estimate does come with a large range of uncertainty as well. .

Antonio Guterres told the General Assembly that polluters should pay for the impact of climate-related events. This question of who funds these losses has long dogged international negotiations. Poor countries say the rich should pay because of their historic carbon emissions. . But richer nations reject any calls for compensation. Arguments over this question are likely to dominate discussions at the forthcoming COP27 summit in Egypt. . As world leaders gather for the UN General Assembly in New York this week, there's no shortage of critical issues on their agenda. . From the war in Ukraine, to food and energy shortages and cost-of-living crises, \"a global winter of discontent\" is on the horizon, according to Mr Guterres. . Central to that is the question of climate change, which the Secretary General believes to be the defining issue of our time. It is a case study in moral and economic justice, he says. . Having recently seen the devastating . flooding in Pakistan.  for himself, Mr Guterres is now doubling down on the need for the rich world to urgently address the demands of the poor. . And there's little doubt whom he believes is responsible for the world's climate emergency. \"The fossil fuel industry is feasting on hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies and windfall profits while household budgets shrink and our planet burns,\" he told the Assembly. \"Today, I am calling on all developed economies to tax the windfall profits of fossil fuel companies. Those funds should be re-directed in two ways: to countries suffering loss and damage caused by the climate crisis; and to people struggling with rising food and energy prices.\". The question of who pays for the impact of climate change that poorer countries cannot adapt to has been a bone of contention between rich and poor for more than a decade. . Richer nations baulk at the idea of paying \"compensation\" for their historic emissions of carbon dioxide which have driven up temperatures. . Mr Guterres' team are quick to point out that the Secretary General is not talking about reparations or a funding facility. They believe the money could be used for practical steps - such as early warning systems - that would benefit struggling nations. . But warning systems alone won't cut much ice with small island and developing states, which believe this issue of loss and damage funding is fundamental to their survival. . According to . newspaper reports. , some of the world's poorest countries have prepared a discussion document for this week's gathering in New York that looks to a \"climate-related and justice-based\" global tax as a means of raising finance. . Among the options are a carbon tax, a tax on airline travel and a levy on the heavy oils used in shipping. . It is unlikely that these proposals will be adopted - and the long-running battle over loss and damage will continue at COP27 in Sharm el Sheikh in November. Developing countries will continue to push strongly for faster progress on finance for loss and damage, and they will at least have moral support from the UN Secretary General. . At COP26 in Glasgow, all countries agreed that there should be a new framework on this issue, but there was no agreement on how it should be funded. .

The report, published in the journal Joule, analysed more than 30 studies that looked at hydrogen and heating. All those studies found that hydrogen was much less efficient and more costly than alternatives like heat pumps. Last week the Business Secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg told the Commons that hydrogen was a \"silver bullet\". Hydrogen, unlike fossil fuels, doesn't give off CO2 when it burns, leading to hopes it could play a key role in decarbonising the economy. What is hydrogen energy and why is it important?. Mr Rees-Mogg said hydrogen could be used as a way to store excess renewable power, and \"with some adjustments piped through to people's houses to heat them during the winter.\". Many energy scientists agree with Mr Rees-Mogg's assessment that hydrogen could play a role in storing energy, for example on a windy or sunny day when renewables are generating more electricity than the grid needs. Many also see it having a future in specialist industries that will prove hard to electrify, like shipping, steel production or aviation.  . \"Using hydrogen for heating may sound attractive at first glance,\" says Jan Rosenow the report's author and Europe Director at the energy think-tank the Regulatory Assistance Project. . \"However, all of the independent research on this topic comes to the same conclusion: heating with hydrogen is a lot less efficient and more expensive than alternatives such as heat pumps, district heating and solar thermal,\" he said. The appeal of hydrogen is that it doesn't release CO2 when burnt, and that it can be made from water, an almost limitless resource. But it's no miracle energy source, with big challenges associated with how the hydrogen is made. Most of the world's hydrogen is currently manufactured using fossil fuels (referred to as grey hydrogen), a process which is more polluting than just using methane gas. . So for hydrogen to be considered \"green\", electricity from renewable sources has to be used to electrolyse water. The problem is that the process is inefficient. . Generating electricity from wind or solar, converting it into hydrogen and then burning the hydrogen at home uses more energy than just using the electricity to directly heat a home, with a heat pump. \"In the UK, heating homes with green hydrogen would use approximately six times more renewable electricity than heat pumps,\" says David Cebon of the Hydrogen Science Coalition and Professor of Mechanical Engineering in Cambridge University. . \"We do not have the time or resources to waste further investigating hydrogen's role in home heating, especially when the well-known laws of thermodynamics determine the answer,\" he said. The report said there was a risk that discussion of hydrogen for heating in the future led to a delay in the deployment of clean heating technologies that are already available today. . \"Low carbon hydrogen could play an important role in helping decarbonising heat in buildings,\" a spokesperson from the Mr Rees-Mogg's ministry the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) told BBC News.  . \"But the government has been clear that a decision on this will not be made until 2026, allowing for full consideration of relevant evidence. The government is currently offering \u00a35,000 grants to encourage people to swap their fossil fuel burning boilers for heat pumps. .

The collision was intentional and designed to test whether space rocks that might threaten Earth could be nudged safely out of the way. Dart's camera returned an image per second, right up to the moment of impact with the target - a 160m-wide object called Dimorphos. What had been a steady image stream cut out as the probe was obliterated. Controllers, based at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU-APL), erupted with joy as Dimorphos filled the field of view on Dart's camera just before then going blank. Initial calculations suggest the impact was a mere 17m off the exact centre of Dimorphos.   . It will be some weeks before scientists on the Nasa-led mission know for sure whether their experiment has worked, but Dr Lori Glaze, the director of planetary science at the space agency, was convinced something remarkable had been achieved. \"We're embarking on a new era of humankind, an era in which we potentially have the capability to protect ourselves from something like a dangerous hazardous asteroid impact. What an amazing thing; we've never had that capability before,\" she told reporters. . And Dr Elena Adams, a JHU-APL mission systems engineer, said \"earthlings should sleep better\" knowing they had a planetary defence solution. . Researchers will determine success, or otherwise, by studying the changes to the orbit of Dimorphos around another asteroid known as Didymos. Telescopes on Earth will make precise measurements of the two-rock, or binary, system. . Before the collision, Dimorphos took roughly 11 hours and 55 minutes to circle its 780m-wide partner. This ought to reduce by a few minutes following the crash. Certainly, on the evidence of the pictures coming back from 11 million km from Earth, everything appeared to go exactly to plan. The Dart probe, moving at the relative velocity of 22,000km/h, had to first distinguish the smaller rock from the larger one. Onboard navigation software then adjusted the closing trajectory with thruster firings to ensure a head-on collision. Scientists were fascinated to see - albeit briefly - the different shapes of the two asteroids. . Didymos, as expected, had a diamond shape. There were boulders on its surface but also some smooth areas. Dr Carolyn Ernst, the instrument scientist on Dart's camera system, was extremely excited to see Dimorphos. . \"It looks adorable; it's this little moon; it's so cute,\" she said. . \"It looks in a lot of ways like some of the other small asteroids we've seen, and they are also covered in boulders. So we suspect it is likely to be a rubble pile, kind of loosely consolidated.\". Dart is an acronym for Double Asteroid Redirection Test. . It was designed to do \"exactly what is says on the tin\", JHU-APL mission lead Dr Andy Rivkin told BBC News. . \"This technique, called the 'kinetic impactor technique' could be used if there were to be an asteroid that was incoming at some point in the future. It's a very simple idea: you ram the spacecraft into the object you're worried about, and you use the mass and the speed of your spacecraft to slightly change the orbit of that object enough so that it would miss the Earth instead of hitting the Earth.\". Dimorphos and Didymos were carefully chosen. Neither was on a path to intersect with Earth before the demonstration, and a small alteration in their orbital relationship will not have increased the risk. . But there are rocks out there that could potentially pose a danger to us. . Although sky surveys have identified more than 95% of the monster asteroids that could initiate a global extinction were they to collide with Earth (they won't; their paths have been computed and they won't come near our planet), this still leaves many so-far undetected smaller objects that could create havoc, if only on the regional or city scale. . An object of Dimorphos's scale would . dig out a crater perhaps 1km across and a couple of hundred metres deep. . The damage in the vicinity of the impact would be intense. Hence the desire to see if an asteroid can be nudged into going slightly slower or faster. The change in velocity wouldn't have to be great, especially if done many years in advance of the expected intersection with Earth. \"An analogy is if you're wearing a wristwatch and you damage it, and it starts running fast by a little bit,\" explained Dart mission scientist Dr Nancy Chabot, also from JHU-APL. \"You might not notice the error in the first day or two, but after a few weeks you will begin to notice that the watch is just not keeping correct time anymore. It's running fast; it's ahead of where it should be.\" . Dart's image stream may have ended abruptly at impact, but there was a small Italian cubesat following three minutes behind. It was snapping away at the safe distance of 50km. The LiciaCube's data will be beamed back to Earth over the next few days. But even in the first picture returns it was evident that the cubesat caught sight of the plume of debris dug out by Dart. Four years from now, the European Space Agency (Esa) will have three spacecraft - collectively known as the Hera mission - at Didymos and Dimorphos to make follow-up studies.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-63039191", "related_stories": ["Impact crater may be dinosaur killer's baby cousin", "Asteroid-strike dinosaur fossil found - scientists", "Dart asteroid-smashing mission launches", "Nasa mission will seek out Solar System 'fossils'", "Winchcombe meteorite gets official classification", "US detects huge meteor explosion"], "related_topics": ["Nasa", "Geology", "Nasa Dart", "Space exploration", "Asteroids"]},

Grey wolves, Eurasian beavers, grey seals, and European bison have seen some of the strongest recoveries in numbers and geographical range. The report. , commissioned by conservation group Rewilding Europe looked at 50 European species. It was compiled by Zoological Society of London, BirdLife International and the European Bird Census Council. The European Wildlife Comeback Report 2022 builds upon earlier research conducted in 2013. It concentrates mostly on species that have seen recoveries over the past 40 to 50 years. \"This new report not only sheds light on which European wildlife species are recovering well, but why they are recovering well too,\" says Rewilding Europe Executive Director Frans Schepers. . \"By learning from the success stories we can maximise wildlife comeback across the board. The report also shows that we must work hard on many fronts, to keep the recovery continuing to happen, and to allow more species to benefit from this.\". Grey wolves are one of the greatest success stories, according to the report. They were found in most areas of Europe at the end of the 18th century before their abundance decreased as human populations rose. They have now repopulated many regions in Europe, where numbers increased by nearly 1,800% between 1965 and 2016, according to the report. Some Scandinavian countries have even allowed culls of wolves in agricultural regions in order to protect livestock. Bird species such as barnacle geese, griffon vultures, great white egrets and Dalmatian pelicans are also recovering well. Rewilding Europe credit these improvements to legal protections made through EU Birds and Habitats Directives and changes in policy and land use. Not all of the species sampled were on the rise. The ringed seal has an uncertain future as its breeding habitat has drastically declined due to reduced ice cover, the report stated. Lead author of the report, Sophie Ledger of ZSL's Institute of Zoology, said the findings gave grounds for hope. \"This report gives cause for optimism and shows that given a chance, and with well-placed conservation efforts, wildlife can recover\" she said.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-63037556", "related_stories": [], "related_topics": ["Wolves", "Rewilding", "Wildlife"]},

The . report from Global Witness.  says that more than 1,700 people have died while trying to prevent mining, oil drilling or logging on their lands. Over the 10 years, Brazil and Colombia have recorded the highest numbers of deaths. Researchers say the figures underestimate the true scale of violence. Earlier this year, the murders of British journalist Dom Phillips and a local indigenous expert, Bruno Pereira, brought . global attention.  to the lawless conditions prevailing in some parts of the Amazon. In this latest report from Global Witness, Latin America is very much the frontline when it comes to deadly attacks on environmental campaigners and activists.  The study finds that 68% of the murders took place across this continent, with Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Honduras recording the highest totals. Many of those who died were indigenous people, often involved in struggles to prevent the exploitation of their lands by mining, oil, logging or hydropower developers. . Researchers believe that as the world attempts to increase the exploitation of fossil fuels in the wake of the war in Ukraine, campaigners will come under greater threats.  In 2021, the year with the most recent data available, some 200 people were killed at a rate of 4 per week. \"There is increasing stress on natural resources globally and this is playing out as a battle particularly in the Amazon in Brazil,\" said Shruti Suresh, from Global Witness, who says that 85% of the killings in Brazil have occurred in this region. . \"This is about land inequality, in that defenders are fighting for their land, and in this increasing race to get more land to acquire and exploit resources, the victims are indigenous communities, local communities, whose voices are being suppressed.\". Colombian human rights activist Oscar Sampayo saw three close friends and fellow activists killed for protesting in 2021. . The anti-fracking campaigner has been actively opposing oil and mining developments in the Magdalena Medio region by documenting the impact on the local community and environment.  . He says the environmental impacts of the war in Ukraine are now being felt even in Colombia. . \"As coal, oil and gas are not bought from Russia, extraction in the global south is deepening, especially in countries like Colombia, regardless of the human rights violations that are generated,\" he told BBC News. . While a new political leadership in Colombia has promised to be more environmentally aware, violence against green activists has been on the increase, according to Oscar.  But despite the attacks on himself and the deaths of his fellow activists he is not ready to quit. \"The assassinations, displacements, exiles and attacks against comrades who defend nature generate concern and demotivates me, but I have not thought of leaving Colombia,\" he explained. . Global Witness argue that around the world the situation for environmental campaigners has become worse not better in recent years. . The activists say that the growing climate and biodiversity crises, and the rise of authoritarian governments, has seen a consecutive rise in killings since 2018. There are other factors at play as well, including the involvement of criminal and drug related gangs in the murders of environmental campaigners. . In 2021, Mexico recorded 54 killings - up from 30 the previous year. Opponents of large-scale mining operations have died but there have also been killings related to illegal mines operated by drug cartels. . Despite the grim statistics and the rise in the number of deaths in recent years, campaigners are hopeful that progress is being made. . In Honduras, a former energy executive was sentenced to 22 years in prison for the . murder of activist Berta C\u00e1ceres in 2016. . . Also giving some encouragement is the Escaz\u00fa agreement, which entered into force in 2021. . It is the first environmental and human rights treaty for Latin America and the Caribbean. It commits countries to prevent and investigate attacks on environmental defenders. While some nations like Mexico have ratified it, others including Brazil and Colombia have not done so yet. . Campaigners also point to plans by the European Union to enact laws that would make companies responsible for human rights abuses in their supply chains. . \"These are game-changing decisions that could make a real positive impact for environmental defenders,\" said Shruti Suresh. \"So there are for sure signs of hope and we should be optimistic. But it is going to be a difficult and challenging road ahead.\".

It marked the final day of a period of national mourning since the Queen's death. The Queen's . state funeral was held at Westminster Abbey.  in London, the historic church where Britain's kings and queens are crowned. A two-minute national silence was held at its end. The Queen's coffin then travelled in a procession to Wellington Arch, at London's Hyde Park Corner, before being taken to Windsor Castle in the State Hearse. After a procession up the castle's Long Walk, a committal service, with a smaller congregation, took place at St George's Chapel. The Queen was buried later at a private family service. At the end of the committal service at Windsor Castle, the Queen's coffin was lowered into the Royal Vault. Later, it was interred at the King George VI memorial chapel, inside St George's Chapel. The Queen was buried together with her late husband, the Duke of Edinburgh. Windsor Castle is in the town of Windsor, about 20 miles west of central London. The castle, which is an official royal residence, has been home to monarchs for almost 1,000 years. . It had special significance to the Queen throughout her life. As a teenager she was sent there during the war years as London faced the threat of bombing. More recently, she made it her permanent home during the coronavirus pandemic. St George's Chapel, within the walls of Windsor Castle, is the church regularly chosen by the Royal Family for weddings, christenings and funerals. . It is where the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, . Prince Harry and Meghan, were married in 2018.  and where the . Queen's late husband Prince Philip's funeral.  was held. Buckingham Palace released the order of service for the funeral, which includes details of all the music and the readings. The order of service for St George's Chapel, Windsor, was also published. About 2,000 guests attended the funeral at Westminster Abbey. Among the members of the Royal Family who were there were Prince George (9) and Princess Charlotte (7), the oldest children of the Prince and Princess of Wales. Joining them were about 500 leaders and dignitaries from the UK and around the world. The guests at the smaller committal service were largely made up of current and former staff from the Queen's household and private estates. A state funeral is typically held for a king or queen and follows strict rules of protocol. . A military procession carries the coffin to Westminster Hall, and is followed by a . period of lying-in-state, and a service at Westminster Abbey or St Paul's Cathedral. . . In rare cases, a state funeral can also be held for \"other exceptionally distinguished persons\". These have included Sir Isaac Newton, Lord Nelson, the Duke of Wellington and Lord Palmerston. Buckingham Palace said that only working members of the Royal Family who hold military rank would wear uniform at the five ceremonial events marking the Queen's death, including the funeral. Prince Andrew and the Duke of Sussex did not wear uniform to most events, although an exception was made for the vigils held in Westminster Hall.

In southern Kherson, Russian guardsmen stood with a ballot box in the middle of the city to collect people's votes. The door-to-door voting is for \"security\", Russian . state media says. \"In-person voting will take place exclusively on 27 September,\" Tass reported. \"On the other days, voting will be organised in communities and in a door-to-door manner.\". One woman in Melitopol told the BBC that two local \"collaborators\" arrived with two Russian soldiers at her parents' flat, to give them a ballot to sign. \"My dad put 'no' [to joining Russia],\" the woman said. \"My mum stood nearby, and asked what would happen for putting 'no'. They said, 'Nothing'. . \"Mum is now worried that the Russians will persecute them.\". The woman also said there was one ballot for the entire household, rather than per person. Although the evidence is anecdotal, the presence of armed men conducting the vote contradicts Moscow's insistence that this is a free or fair process. Experts say the self-styled referendums, taking place across five days, will allow Russia to claim - illegally - four occupied or partially-occupied regions of Ukraine as their own. . In other words, a false vote on annexation, seven months into Russia's invasion. . The \"annexation\" would not be recognised internationally, but could lead to Russia claiming that its territory is under attack from Western weapons supplied to Ukraine, which could escalate the war further. US President Joe Biden . described the referendums.  as \"a sham\", saying they were a \"false pretext\" to try to annex parts of Ukraine by force in violation of international law. . \"The United States will never recognise Ukrainian territory as anything other than part of Ukraine,\" he said. . British Foreign Secretary, James Cleverly, said the UK had evidence that Russian officials had already set targets for \"invented voter turnouts and approval rates for these sham referenda\". Mr Cleverly said Russia planned to formalise the annexation of the four regions - Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia - by the end of the month. A source in Kherson told the BBC there was no public effort to encourage voting, apart from an announcement on the Russian news agency that people can vote at a port building, which had been disused for 10 years. . Another woman in Kherson said she saw \"armed militants\" outside the building where the vote seemed to be taking place. She pretended to forget her passport, so she didn't have to vote. The woman said all her friends and family were against the referendum. \"We don't know how our life will be after this referendum,\" she said. \"It is very difficult to understand what they want to do.\". Kyiv says the referendums will change nothing, and its forces will continue to push to liberate all of the territories. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin's recent mobilisation of at least 300,000 extra troops has caused many Russian men of fighting age to flee. . One young Russian man who left St Petersburg for Kazakhstan to avoid the draft told . BBC World Service's Outside Source programme.  that that most of his friends were also on the move. \"Right now, I feel like it's a total collapse. I know only maybe one or two folks that don't think about exile right now,\" he said. He said some, like him, are travelling across the border, whereas others have gone to small Russian villages to hide. . \"The big problem of Russia is that we didn't think about the war in Ukraine in February as we think about it right now,\" he said.

OVD-Info said 724 people were detained across 32 different cities on Saturday. Widespread demonstrations have broken out since President Vladimir Putin announced plans to draft 300,000 men to fight in Ukraine. . Unsanctioned rallies are banned under Russian law. . But Mr Putin's move to draft civilians into the military has sparked large scale protests in urban areas, with more than 1,000 people being detained at demonstrations earlier this week. . In Moscow, news agency AFP reported witnessing one demonstrator shouting \"we are not cannon fodder\" as she was arrested by officers. . And in St Petersburg, Russia's second city, one man told reporters: \"I don't want to go to war for Putin.\". Seventy-year-old Natalya Dubova told AFP that she opposed the war and confessed she was \"afraid for young people\" being ordered to the front. . Some of those arrested on Saturday reported being given their draft papers after being detained. The Kremlin defended the practice earlier this week, saying \"it isn't against the law\". Moscow has also approved harsh new punishments for those accused of dereliction of duty once drafted. . Mr Putin signed fresh decrees on Saturday imposing punishments of up to 10 years imprisonment for any soldier caught surrendering, attempting to desert the military or refusing to fight. . The president also signed orders granting Russian citizenship to any foreign national who signs up to serve a year in the country's military. . The decree, which some observers have suggested displays how severe Moscow's shortage of troops has become, bypasses the usual requirement of five years of residency in the country. . Elsewhere, other young Russians continue to flee mobilisation by seeking to leave the country. . On the border with Georgia, queues of Russian cars stretch back more than 30km (18 miles) and the interior ministry has urged people not to travel. . Local Russian officials have admitted that there's been a significant influx of cars trying to cross - with nearly 2,500 vehicles waiting at one checkpoint. . The admission is a change of tone from Russia, with the Kremlin describing reports of Russians fleeing conscription as \"fake\" on Thursday. . One man the BBC spoke to in Vladikavkaz in North Ossetia, on the Russian side of the border, said he could see car registration numbers from all over Russia. \"Our people don't have the correct information about the situation in Ukraine,\" he said. \"Also, what I can say about people that I've been speaking with\u2026 it's simple, people don't want to go to war.\". Meanwhile, Finland has also seen a sharp increase in the number of Russians seeking to enter the country. . Matti Pitkaniitty, a spokesperson for the country's Border Guard, said the number of Russians arriving had more than doubled since last week. . On Friday, the government announced plans to stop Russian tourists entering the country. . \"The aspiration and purpose is to significantly reduce the number of people coming to Finland from Russia,\" President Sauli Niinist\u00f6 told the state broadcaster. . Several other neighbouring states have already ruled out offering asylum to Russians seeking to avoid the draft. . \"Many Russians who now flee Russia because of mobilisation were fine with killing Ukrainians,\" Latvia's Foreign Minister Edgars Rink\u0113vi\u010ds said. \"They did not protest then. It is not right to consider them as conscientious objectors.\" . On Friday, the Kremlin revealed a host of occupations it said will be exempt from conscription aimed at boosting its war effort in Ukraine. IT workers, bankers and journalists working for state media will escape the \"partial mobilisation\" announced by President Putin on Wednesday. But some have cast doubt on the truth of the Kremlin's claims, and reports have been emerging of Russian men who do not meet the criteria being called up by local recruiting officers. Margarita Simonyan, the editor of the state-run media outlet RT, posted to Twitter a list of elderly and disabled citizens ordered to report for duty. .", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-63021118", "related_stories": [], "related_topics": ["Russia-Ukraine war", "Russia", "St Petersburg", "Moscow", "Vladimir Putin", "Ukraine"]},

More than half of those are families with children. . The government said councils have a duty to find them accommodation. The statistics show 74 households are either homeless or at risk in Hampshire, 27 in Oxfordshire, 14 in Reading and 12 from the Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole area.

However, Russian forces still hold about a fifth of the country. Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, surrounding the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. It also launched attacks in the south, east and north of the country. In early April, Ukrainian forces retook large areas around Kyiv, after Russia abandoned its push towards the capital. Russia has since been focusing its military operations in the south, east and north-east of Ukraine, seizing large areas. However, things changed dramatically at the start of September. In a decisive offensive in the north-east, Ukraine drove back Russian forces. It claims to have regained 3,000 square kilometres (1,158 sq miles) of territory around the city of Kharkiv alone. Its forces have also retaken territory in Luhansk, in eastern Ukraine. Since July, the region had been entirely occupied by Russia. In total, Ukraine says it has retaken more than 8,000 sq km (3,088 sq miles) from Russian control in September - its most significant territorial gains since the war started. The cities of Izyum and Kupiansk, which Ukraine says were retaken on 10 September, were both key supply hubs for the Russian forces. As such, these represent important strategic gains. There is also a Ukrainian counter-attack around the Kherson region in the south of the country. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) says Ukrainian troops have inflicted a \"major operational defeat\" on Russian forces. Justin Bronk of the Royal United Services Institute said Russian positions in Kharkiv had suffered a \"total collapse\". The Russian withdrawal was, he said, \"certainly the most dramatic reverse that we've seen from the Russians since they retreated from Kyiv in April\". Russia confirmed that its forces retreated from Izyum and Kupiansk. It said this was a strategic withdrawal to \"regroup\". It has also said it will continue to target these areas with military strikes. The Russian army appears to have abandoned large quantities of equipment and ammunition during the withdrawal. Russia still holds about 20% of Ukraine, according to the ISW. The areas are largely in the eastern Donbas region and in the south of mainland Ukraine, as well as . the Crimea peninsula which Russia annexed in 2014. .  . The Donbas is a mainly Russian-speaking area, and after Russia seized Crimea in 2014, . pro-Russian forces captured more than a third of the region. . It created two so-called people's republics there. Areas in the west of the country, including Lviv, have experienced missile attacks, but no attempt by Russian forces to take and occupy ground. Russia refuses to recognise its invasion as a war, and says it is undertaking a \"special military operation\" in Ukraine. The Kremlin said its operations would continue \"until all the tasks originally set\" had been achieved. When launching the invasion in February, President Vladimir Putin said his goal was to \". demilitarise Ukraine. \". One objective was to ensure Ukraine didn't join the Western defensive alliance, Nato. . Russia's initial aim was to overrun Ukraine and depose its government. However, it now appears to have limited its ambitions to securing land in Ukraine's east and south. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said his main goal is to drive all Russian troops out, to \"de-occupy our whole territory\". Mr Zelensky has appealed for more funding and equipment to retain the areas retaken from Russia. Western shipments of weaponry are being used heavily by Ukrainian forces. Both sides have suffered losses, although neither publish exact numbers. Ukraine claims it has killed more than 50,000 Russian troops, and at the end of August said it had . lost nearly 9,000 military personnel.  since the start of the conflict. Russia rarely discloses its own troop fatalities. Its most recent death count was in March, . when it said 1,351 Russian soldiers had died since the invasion began. In July, .

In the 1951 census, just 624 people with South Asian heritage were recorded as living in Leicester. Now, 70 years on, the city has one of the highest proportions of British South Asians. . The journey of the early post-war arrivals from the Indian subcontinent to the East Midlands can be traced back to two moments that took place a few years before that census. . Firstly, there was the . 1947 partition of British India.  into two independent dominions - India and Pakistan - which saw the eruption of deadly religious violence, and left between 10-12 million people displaced. And then, there was the 1948 British Nationality Act - which gave every Commonwealth citizen the right to move to the UK. . Many people, whose lives had been disrupted by partition, heeded calls from their former colonial ruler to help rebuild the UK and start new lives.  . From the 1950s, Indians and Pakistanis came to Leicester through so-called chain migration - via previous family members or villagers who were already settled in the city. Leicester was attractive - it was prosperous and had jobs available at employers like Dunlop, Imperial Typewriters, and the large hosiery mills. . Many of the new arrivals lived, at first, in affordable private housing around Spinney Hill Park and Belgrave Road - in north and east Leicester - the site of some of the most recent unrest. Most came from Punjab - a region stretching across modern-day northern Pakistan and north-western India. They were Sikh, Muslim and Hindus - who had seen the effects of partition and religious hatred - and worked together in Leicester, often through the city's Indian Workers Association, to campaign on issues of race and to fight for equality. . By the early 1960s, wives and children from the Indian subcontinent had joined their husbands. And then - in the middle of the decade - East African South Asians, predominantly Gujaratis, began to arrive. They had faced increasing restrictions as places previously under British rule or protection - such as Tanganyika and Zanzibar, which became Tanzania, and Kenya - gained independence. . Many settled in Belgrave, Rushey Mead and the Melton Road areas of Leicester. . When Ugandan Prime Minister, Idi Amin, expelled Asians in 1972, Leicester City Council anticipated more arrivals. It took out adverts in the Ugandan press discouraging refugees, with a right to settle in the UK, from making the city their destination. But still people came, with many of the East African Asian community starting their own successful businesses - including in retail, hosiery and manufacturing.  . By 1971, there were 20,190 people of South Asian heritage in Leicester. In response to the surge in numbers arriving from former colonies, the far-right National Front grew in popularity locally. . Emeritus Professor of Sikh and Punjab Studies at SOAS University of London, Gurharpal Singh, has lived nearly all his life in Leicester - after arriving from Punjab in 1964. His father was a manager at the Walkers Crisps factory in the city. . He recalls regular overt racism growing up, whether at school or from his neighbours, and the terror of seeing the National Front marching in the streets. . The far-right group's high point came in the 1976 local election, where they came within 61 votes of victory in Abbey Ward, and gained 18% of the total vote across the city. Throughout the decade, the anti-racist fight back saw British Muslims, Sikhs and Hindus working together. But on the streets, at times, there were clashes between anti-racists and the National Front. . A change in the law in 1976 meant that local councils had become responsible for race relations - and by the 1980s, British South Asians were represented on the city council. . The local authority embraced the promotion of religious and cultural activities. During the decade, Leicester became a city of Asian festivals marking Diwali in the Belgrave area's \"Golden Mile\" with crowds of thousands - as well as Eid and Vaisakhi. . Leicester became \"largely a model city\", says Prof Tariq Modood, a founding director of the Centre for the Study of Ethnicity and Citizenship at the University of Bristol. . But there were times, when the politics of the Indian subcontinent spilt over into Leicester's streets. . Prof Singh recalls \"random attacks\" by Sikh militants in Leicester in 1984 after Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's armed forces stormed the Sikh shrine, The Golden Temple, in Amritsar - leaving hundreds dead. . In 2002, Prof Singh watched on TV as events unfolded in Gujarat, in western India - after a fire on a train carrying Hindu pilgrims killed  more than 50 people. Riots followed - and more than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, were murdered in one of the worst cases of communal violence between Hindus and Muslims since Indian Independence in 1947. . \"Those were the first riots [in India] covered in real time by the global media on 24 hour news,\" he tells me - recalling that in Leicester some took to the streets. \"There certainly were widespread demonstrations in support of the victims, but no violence.\". The politics of the Indian subcontinent has started to be felt in another way in Leicester since 2014, says Prof Singh, when the . Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).  took power in India. . The rise of the BJP has fostered a brand of nationalism among the diaspora, he says. \"The party is popular among Leicester's Gujarati Hindu community which manifests in the outlook and politics of the community.\". Even more recently, Prof Singh says he has seen the demographics of the city changing again. \"South Asians have arrived from South Africa and Malawi, in particular, as well as India itself - where some have grown up with the hard-line politics of Hindu nationalism.\". And then, he says, there are more local challenges for some in Leicester's South Asian communities - including the new arrivals. High deprivation and unemployment and social issues - with the city experiencing segregation of communities. Leicester disorder:. Some tensions in Leicester had been brewing for a while, he says - and while it is still unclear what sparked the recent unrest, which has seen dozens of arrests, \"what is surprising is the magnitude of violence. In Leicester it has never got to the point of confrontation before.\". Videos shared by both Hindus and Muslims on social media, allegedly taken during the recent unrest, suggest anger on both sides. . Footage featured masked men pulling down religious decorations and banging on people's windows in Hindu-majority areas. One video appeared to show a man climbing onto the roof of a Hindu temple and pulling down a religious flag, another showed a flag being set alight. While in predominantly Muslim-populated streets, footage appears to show the slogan \"Pakistan Murdabad\" - meaning down with, or death to, Pakistan - being chanted after the Pakistan-India cricket match at the end of August. \"Jai Shri Ram\" - meaning glory or victory to Hindu's Lord Rama - has been heard more recently. \"[Jai Shri Ram] has a devotional meaning,\" says Prof Modood, \"but has been appropriated and is a charged term used by anti-Muslim Hindu extremists.\" . Fake information and misinformation - deliberately intended to mislead - are also being spread and exploited on social media. . Instigated by small factions in different South Asian communities here and globally, the posts use incidents in Leicester in an inflammatory way to further fuel tensions. The unrest reportedly being further stoked by influence from outside the city. Leicester has seen many waves of migration, but this new violence between small sections of British South Asian communities is alarming. Such scenes between Hindus and Muslims is extremely rare in the UK - especially in Leicester. Many locals, including families who have now lived in the city for several generations, are shocked and disturbed by what they are witnessing on their streets. . \"It is very disappointing,\" says Prof Modood, \"that one of the cities where multiculturalism had taken root has had these scarring events.\"  .

Officers at the Verkhniy Lars crossing will be tasked with serving summons to \"citizens of the mobilisation age\", the authorities say. Recent satellite images have shown queues going for miles from Russia. All those crossing into Georgia look exhausted, a BBC correspondent says. They are hungry and sleep deprived - but relieved to have reached safety, Rayhan Demytrie says. People have been coming in groups of walkers, dragging their suitcases behind them. Others have arrived in car or on bikes. One man, Ilya, showed our correspondent a polaroid of his baby daughter Arisha. He said he wanted to see her grow up, and not die in the senseless war in Ukraine. . Dima and Zhenya, two brothers in their early 20s, said they had travelled for days from Bashkiria - Russia's republic about 1,500km (932 miles) east of the capital Moscow. Dima asked for a hotspot to call his mother. On the other end of the line there was a sigh of relief. Another young man from Moscow said the reason he was fleeing was because of the man in the Kremlin, President Vladimir Putin. . Everyone says the same thing: they disagree with the war - but the extent of repression in Russia makes them powerless, our correspondent says. The interior ministry of Russia's North Ossetia republic, where the Verkhniy Lars crossing is, said 60 of its personnel had already been deployed there, describing the situation as \"extremely tense\". . It added that the army enlisting centre would be opened \"in the nearest future\". Long queues have also been reported on Russia's border crossings with Mongolia and Kazakhstan. . Kazakhstan's President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev vowed on Tuesday to protect the safety and welfare of Russians fleeing a \"hopeless situation\". The Russian defence ministry on Tuesday said it would not seek the extradition of Russian nationals travelling abroad to avoid being drafted into the army. President Putin announced what he described as a partial mobilisation on 21 September, with Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu later saying 300,000 reservists would be called up. But reports in opposition Russian media suggested that up to one million people could be called up, pointing out that the actual number of those who would be enlisted was classified. A number of military experts in the West and Ukraine say Mr Putin's decision to call up reservists shows that Russian troops are failing badly on the battlefield in Ukraine - more than seven months after Moscow launched its invasion. In an unusual move on Monday, . the Kremlin admitted that mistakes were being made in its mobilisation drive. , amid growing public opposition across the vast country. \"There are cases when the decree is violated,\" Mr Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, adding that \"all the errors will be corrected\". On Tuesday, Sergei Baranovsky, the top official responsible for war mobilisation efforts in the extreme north-eastern Magadan region, was sacked. Multiple reports - backed by footage on social media - say people with no military experience, or who are too old or disabled, are being called up. Since the mobilisation announcement, more than 2,000 people have been detained at protests across Russia. \"We are deeply disturbed by the large number of people who have reportedly been arrested,\" UN rights office spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani said on Tuesday. In one of the most shocking and widely-discussed incidents, a man shot and critically injured an army recruitment officer in the Siberian city of Ust-llimsk on Monday.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-63050880", "related_stories": ["Drone video shows scale of people leaving Russia.

Denounced as illegitimate and a sham by Ukraine and the West, these so-called votes are taking place over five days while all four areas - two in the east and two in the south - are on the front line. An annexation could lead to a claim by Russia that its territory is coming under attack from Western weapons supplied to Ukraine. This could escalate the war further. Seven months after Russia's invasion began, Vladimir Putin is on the back foot. Ukraine's counter-offensive has recaptured swathes of territory seized since the 24 February invasion. . A vote on annexation is one of three steps taken by the Kremlin in an attempt to reset the war. By annexing another 15% of sovereign Ukraine, Russia will be able to claim its territory is under attack from weapons provided by Nato and other Western countries to Ukraine. . By calling up 300,000 extra troops,.  it can defend a front line of 1,000km (620 miles). The Kremlin has also criminalised desertion, surrender and going absent without leave during mobilisation. If Russia's leader annexing territory sounds familiar, it is. When he ordered troops to seize Crimea in 2014, he followed it up with a vote rejected as an illegitimate sham by the international community. This latest event has also been denounced as illegal.  by many Western countries, including international monitoring group, the OSCE, and Russian media have already said that a Yes-vote is beyond doubt. It is taking place over five days in Russia's two proxy areas in Luhansk and Donetsk in the east, and in occupied parts of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in the south. . We have already seen how Crimea was annexed by Russia in 2014. While the Kremlin claimed 96.7% support, a leaked report from Russia's Human Rights Council said only around 30% had voted and barely half supported annexation. Barely a shot was fired in Crimea, and yet in this latest case voting is expected to take place in the middle of a war. . The four regions involved are either partially or completely under occupation. . In the south, the city of . Kherson.  is not a safe place right now, with Russian soldiers struggling to hold back a big Ukrainian counter-offensive. The central administration building was hit by a series of missiles only last week. . A secure vote is impossible, and yet officials talk of 750,000 people registered and plans to incorporate occupied parts of another Ukrainian region, Mykolayiv, into the annexed area. . Russian media reported that electoral officials would go from door-to-door with portable ballot boxes from Friday to Monday. Polling stations will only operate on the fifth day, 27 September, with officials citing security reasons. Hundreds of stations are scheduled to open that day, with voters also able to cast ballots in regions outside their own - and refugees eligible to vote in parts of Russia itself. Then there's . Zaporizhzhia's . capital, which remains securely in Ukrainian hands, so any vote to annex that region makes little sense. Donetsk.  in the east is only 60% under Russian occupation and very much at the heart of the conflict. . Russia does control most of . Luhansk.  in the north-east even if it has begun to lose ground. Russian news agencies showed flyers being handed out entitled \"Russia is the future\". Much of the pre-war population has fled the conflict. The head of Russia's proxy authority in Donetsk, Denis Pushilin, ordered a mass evacuation days before the invasion. Russian-backed leaders have been keen to stage votes for several months, but the decision to hold the vote was taken just three days in advance and smacks of desperation. . There will be no independent observers. Much of the voting will be online, although officials have promised extra security at polling stations. Ukrainian defence ministry adviser Yuriy Sak told the BBC the so-called referendums were doomed. \"We are seeing that local populations are all in favour of returning to Ukraine, and this is why there's so much guerrilla movement resistance in these territories.\". In any event, Kyiv says nothing will change and its forces will continue to push to liberate the territories. Russia analyst Alexander Baunov says merely redefining the occupied areas as Russian territory is unlikely to stop Ukraine's army, but it does send a message of intent to the populations under their control. And the Kremlin's hope is that the West will baulk at having its weapons fired at land declared by Moscow as Russian. Alarmingly President Putin has spoken of using all means at his disposal \"to protect Russia\". And in case there was any doubt at all, the deputy head of Russia's security council, Dmitry Medvedev, made clear that nuclear weapons could also be used to protect annexed territories. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has spoken of a \"dangerous escalation\", but reaffirmed Washington's position that no Russian claim to Ukrainian soil could take away Ukraine's right to defend itself. Even Turkey, which has sought to play a mediating role, has damned the vote as illegitimate.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-62973415", "related_stories": ["Who is winning the war in Ukraine?", "Russian retreat exposes troop and kit weaknesses", "Mass exhumations at Ukraine forest graves site", "Russian pop megastar condemns war in Ukraine"], "related_topics": ["Russia-Ukraine war", "Russia", "Zaporizhzhia", "Vladimir Putin", "Ukraine"]},

Moscow-installed officials in the regions are now claiming almost total support among those who took part in the disputed votes on joining Russia. The polls were denounced as a sham by Ukraine's government and its allies. In the absence of international recognition, the process was not monitored independently. The votes were held in the breakaway eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. Ballots in Russian-occupied parts of the southern regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia were also organised. Refugees scattered across Russia were also able to vote at dozens of polling stations, including in Crimea, a southern Ukrainian peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014. Partial results from voting there indicated huge majorities in favour of joining Russia. Up to four million people were asked to vote in the war-torn regions, which make up about 15% of Ukraine's territory. News agencies run by the pro-Kremlin administrations in Donetsk and Luhansk are reporting that up to 99.23% of people voted in favour of joining Russia - a high percentage that would be unusual in a vote of this nature. There is speculation that Russian President Vladimir Putin may announce the four regions' annexation in a speech to a joint session of Russia's parliament on Friday. In March 2014, he announced that Crimea had joined Russia just a few days after a similarly unrecognised referendum was held there. If Russia annexes the four regions, which Moscow does not fully control, it could take the war to a new and more dangerous level, with Moscow portraying any attempt by Ukraine to regain them as an attack on its sovereign territory. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of \"brutally violating the UN statute\" by trying to annex territories seized by force. \"This farce in the occupied territory cannot even be called an imitation of referendums,\" he said on Tuesday night. The president added that it was \"a very cynical attempt to force men in the occupied territory of Ukraine to mobilise into the Russian army in order to send them to fight against their own homeland!\". Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called on the EU to impose tougher sanctions on Russia. \"We need an extremely serious, effective response with specific things that will hit the Russian economy. The softer the reaction to the so-called referendums, the greater the motivation for Russia to escalate and annex further territories,\" he said. The UK responded to the so-called referendums with new sanctions targeting top Russian officials involved in enforcing the votes. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken reiterated that the West would never recognise Russian annexations, warning the Kremlin of \"additional swift and severe costs\". . French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna, who on Tuesday visited Ukraine, described the polls as a \"masquerade\". In China, a traditional Russian ally, foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said the \"sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries must be respected\", when answering a reporter's question about the so-called referendums. President Putin defended the referendums, saying they were designed to stop the persecution of ethnic Russians and Russian-speakers by Ukraine - a charge the Ukrainian government denies. \"Saving people in all the territories where this referendum is being held is at the top of our minds and the focus of attention of our entire society and country,\" the Russian leader said in televised remarks. The results of the four self-styled referendums will be of little surprise to anyone, least of all Ukraine. The votes in favour of joining Russia are a continuation of the Kremlin's narrative of trying to \"liberate\" Ukrainians in those areas, as well as its attempts to legitimise its presence in the country. Ukraine and the West have discredited the process, and the BBC has heard evidence of armed soldiers collecting votes door to door, as well as claims of voting not being held at all. Russia is expected to draft quick, new laws around the annexation of these four contested territories, and has threatened the use of more lethal weapons if they are targeted in the future. What Kyiv has always said is that its objectives have not changed, regardless of the statements (and now results) which come from Moscow. Early voting took place over four days, as election officials escorted by soldiers visited people's homes. Polling stations only opened on Tuesday. \"With my voice, I want to try to make a small contribution to stopping the war,\" Galina Korsakova, 63, from Donetsk told AFP news agency at a polling station in Crimea. \"I really want to go home.\". The unrecognised plebiscites were held as the war raged on, and at least one election official was killed, in a missile attack in the Zaporizhzhia city of Berdyansk. Since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, tens of thousands of combatants and civilians have been killed or injured, while whole cities and towns have been largely reduced to ruins. More than 7.4 million Ukrainians are currently recorded as refugees, including nearly 2.7 million in Russia, .

Three men died instantly, the fourth one fought for his life for an hour and a half, another one in critical condition was taken to hospital. We have hardly any men left and we are holding a front line dozens of kilometres long.\". While Russian officials and state media are trying to play down the Russian forces' retreat from Kharkiv, individual war reporters, veterans and influential military bloggers are acknowledging numerous challenges within closed messaging channels. . Blogs and Telegram channels are littered with stories of inadequate equipment and personnel, compounded by a rigid operational hierarchy. One Telegram channel, sharing experiences of soldiers in the field in Ukraine shortly after the latest retreat, describes how even deploying a small surveillance drone needs to be approved by a senior officer or a general, considerably slowing down understanding of enemy positions. Another channel on Telegram, reportedly run by a Russian special forces veteran, has posted a photo of a Russian soldier sporting an arm patch embroidered with the words: \"There is no opponent worse than your own commander who is a\u2026\" using an expletive to describe him. . There is no way of knowing where and when the image was shot, but what is significant is that it has been widely shared by both veterans and forces in the field, suggesting it reflects popular opinion among the country's rank and file. . Despite rumours of low morale, Russian war reporters and paramilitary soldiers serving in Ukraine are not suggesting that widespread desertion in the field contributed to the latest rout in eastern Ukraine. They say it is much more likely that units simply obeyed an order to retreat. Some Russian fighters on another channel joke bitterly that the \"special military operation\" - as the Russian government publicly terms it - \"has no goals, it only has a path\".   . There are not only concerns about poor leadership. Basic equipment appears to be in such short supply that it is having to be crowdfunded. Dozens of public social media groups are collecting money for a whole range of kit -  everything from drones to socks and underwear. . One of them, called \"The People's Front\", says it has raised about 1.5bn roubles (\u00a315m, $17m) over the past three months, and has already spent it on uniforms, helmets and flak jackets, as well as first-aid kits, binoculars and thermal imagers. . Despite such fundraising, hundreds of pleas have been posted online from dozens of military units - including pilots of Russia's most modern fighter jets - for specific items, such as fire-proof uniforms, torches and two-way radios. But the issue is not just a lack of equipment, it is a lack of troops. . While there are no signs of imminent compulsory conscription, there has been a push for recruitment - described by the government as an \"informal mobilisation\" - since soon after the country's invasion of Ukraine. The Russian Ministry of Defence started posting adverts on popular job websites in early March, something which was rarely done before the war. On one website there are more than 7,000 military vacancies listed - . for gunners. , mortar crew and other combat-focused roles. None of the adverts mention the \"special military operation\" in Ukraine. . Recruitment flyers have also been posted through doors, and displayed on public transport and outside residential apartment blocks and even psychiatric hospitals. . Drafting centres have also resorted to phoning soldiers who have left or retired to ask them to re-join, some of those contacted told the BBC. One soldier who fought in Chechnya in the 1990s says he and his friends were called three or four times. The man, who asked to remain anonymous, says he finally agreed but later refused to sign the contract, put off by what appeared to be poor conditions. Possibly to make the proposition of serving more attractive, the minimum contract length has been slashed from three years to three months, and the upper age limit for a first contract raised from 40 to 60 years old. . Advertised monthly salaries range from 100,000-450,000 roubles (\u00a31,000-\u00a34,500, $1,139-$5,125) - a tempting proposition, despite the dangers of deployment, for those with poor job prospects in economically deprived areas of the country. . Russia is believed to be sending several of these scratch units to Ukraine every 10 days, following training of just a week or less. . Two separate sources on the front line told the BBC that such units, comprising short-term military contractors and fighters from the Wagner mercenary group - the head of which has been . filmed recruiting in a central Russian prison.  - constitute the bulk of Russia's current frontline force. There are reports that those signing contracts may not all be doing so willingly. Russian human rights activists allege there have been cases of men in Chechnya being pressured into joining up by the authorities.  . Russian independent journalists have reported that up to 500 convicts have also been enlisted. One prisoner, Konstantin Tulinov, was lauded in state media after he was killed during combat in July. Tulinov had served multiple sentences, the latest one for torturing inmates in Russian prisons. Whilst these challenges are being discussed within closed groups, there has been no official acknowledgement of the retreat. . On his private Telegram channel, influential state war reporter Yevgeny Poddubny suggested that the latest rout exposed long-running issues. \"The situation is really hard for our troops. The problems which have been discussed both in the public space and during confidential meetings have become obvious.\". But there is no evidence that this message is making its way to the top. Poddubny and several other war reporters were seen speaking briefly with President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the St Petersburg economic forum in June. . While it is not clear exactly what they managed to explain to the president, lack of supplies remains a key issue for the Russian military. .", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-62914958", "related_stories": ["A successful surprise attack - but danger looms", "Zelensky meets troops in Ukraine's recaptured city", "Putin does not see Ukraine war as mistake - Scholz"], "related_topics": ["Russia-Ukraine war", "Russia", "Ukraine"]},

In an address to the nation, he said Russia was directly threatened with \"disintegration\" by the Western powers backing the Kyiv government. He also warned Nato that nuclear-armed Russia could use any weapons in its armoury against what he called Western \"nuclear blackmail\". His message came a day after Russian-installed leaders in four regions of eastern and southern Ukraine announced plans for so-called referendums - starting this week - on joining Russia. Crimea was annexed by Russia after just such a move in 2014. Russia plans to call up about 300,000 reservists - that is, people who have had military training and, Vladimir Putin stressed, have specialist skills needed in the Ukraine conflict. They will include many reserve officers, including some over 60, pulled in from retirement. Russia could in theory mobilise some 25 million people for military service, but that is not yet being considered. Both President Putin and Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu stressed that conscripts would not be sent to fight in Ukraine. Mr Shoigu said the extra troops were required to defend a front line stretching for some 1,000km (600 miles). The mobilisation will be spread over months - and Mr Putin has said previously that Russia is prepared for a long fight. Reuters news agency says it is Russia's first mobilisation since World War Two, but the Kremlin did send thousands of conscripts to fight in Afghanistan in the 1980s, and later in Chechnya, in the North Caucasus. . Many poorly-trained conscripts were killed in those costly wars, and this time the Kremlin appears anxious to avoid fuelling anti-war sentiment. Russia's military is numerically superior to Ukraine's, but Ukraine's battlefield tactics and precision Western weapons have narrowed that gap. . Russia's initial invasion force in February numbered about 190,000 troops, in addition to thousands of pro-Russian fighters in the Donbas region. . The Kremlin launched a massive recruitment drive, offering big financial incentives. So extra troops were drafted in, especially from poor regions of Siberia and the Caucasus, including experienced Chechen fighters. . Russia has a normal limit of just over a million military personnel and almost 900,000 civilian staff - but last month President Putin signed a decree to recruit 137,000 more. Currently Russian men aged 18-27 are obliged to do military service, usually for one year, but there are many exemptions on medical grounds or for students. Russia initially denied sending conscript soldiers to Ukraine, but several officers were disciplined after cases came to light of conscripts being forced to sign contracts. President Putin then insisted no conscripts would be sent into combat. Before the invasion Ukraine's military numbers were much smaller - about 196,600 active troops. But Kyiv ordered a mass mobilisation, which has boosted those numbers. . Ukraine's big counter-offensive in the northern Kharkiv region has put the Kremlin on the back foot, Western analysts and politicians say - which explains Vladimir Putin's latest move. Defence Minister Shoigu gave a new death toll on Wednesday - 5,937 Russian troops killed. But that is still far below the estimate of 25,000 dead given by the UK defence ministry in June, while Ukraine claims the figure is about 50,000. . It has emerged that Russia is . recruiting prisoners to fight. , as it struggles with its heavy losses. In the 1979-1989 war in Afghanistan the Soviet military lost about 15,000 troops. BBC Russian has established that Russia's losses in Ukraine include more than 1,000 elite officers, including many pilots, intelligence experts and special forces. President Putin castigated Kyiv's Western supporters for making anti-Russian \"threats\" - and warned that any threat to Russia's territorial integrity would be met with whatever weapons the Kremlin deemed necessary. \"Our country also has various weapons of mass destruction and, in some categories, more modern ones than those possessed by Nato countries,\" he said. \"This is no bluff,\" he added. Russia's military doctrine allows the use of tactical nuclear weapons if the Russian state is threatened with destruction. Russia has already used . long-range hypersonic missiles.  in Ukraine, which can fly faster than 6,000 km/h (3,730 mph). But analysts say that has not been a game-changer. If Russia claims, after controversial referendums, that more parts of Ukraine have joined Russia it may then also claim that Russia itself is under Nato attack. . Kyiv and Western leaders see the \"referendums\" as disguise for a Russian land grab. US Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink said \"sham referenda\" and mobilisation were signs of Russian weakness. . Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte called Mr Putin's military move \"a sign of panic\". . \"His rhetoric on nuclear weapons is something we have heard many times before,\" he said, adding that it left him untroubled. Other Western politicians have also played down any threat of nuclear escalation.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-62981289", "related_stories": ["Putin orders 10% boost in Russian troop numbers", "What is Russia's Wagner Group of mercenaries?", "Russia claims first use of hypersonic missile"], "related_topics": ["Russia-Ukraine war", "Russia", "Nato", "Vladimir Putin", "Ukraine"]},

Russia seems set to annex Ukrainian territory that voted in self-styled referendums. One consequence is likely to be further sanctions from the West.

The latest measures would look to ban Russian exports worth $7 billion (\u00a36.4 billion) and tighten restrictions on goods flowing from the EU that could help Russia's war machine. . The EU's executive has also proposed a price cap on Russian oil aimed at limiting how much third countries, such as China and India, pay for Russian crude. .

The leaks on the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 pipelines were discovered on Monday and Tuesday. . Neither pipeline was operating at the time, as the Nord Stream 2 project was abandoned when Russia invaded Ukraine, and Russia shut down Nord Stream 1 in September, citing a need for maintenance. . But both pipelines were still full of gas, which bubbled to the surface in an area a kilometre wide on the sea's surface. . Danish Energy Minister Dan Jorgensen said the leaks were likely to last for at least a week, until the gas escaping from the pipes runs out. An investigation has been launched. European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen has promised the \"strongest possible response\" if the attack is proven to have been deliberate. President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov has dismissed accusations of sabotage as \"predictable, stupid and absurd\". Mr Peskov said he was \"extremely concerned\" about the leaks, adding that the possibility of a deliberate attack could not be ruled out. . In the aftermath of the alleged attacks, Norway - now Europe's largest gas supplier - has decided to deploy its military to protect crucial infrastructure. . Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere told a news conference that the military would be \"more visible\" at oil and gas installations. Any attack would be handled jointly with allies, he said. . The Navy would be deployed to protect offshore installations, while police could increase presence at onshore facilities, he said. . Equinor, a Norwegian state-owned energy company, also said on Wednesday that it had also stepped up security measures. Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said he had discussed the protection of critical infrastructure with the defence minister of Denmark, the country closest to the damage. . And in the US, White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the country would continue its work to safeguard Europe's energy security. .

Mike Fulwood, a senior research fellow at the independent Oxford Institute for Energy Studies told the BBC sabotage was, indeed, the most likely cause of the leaks. \"To rupture an offshore pipeline is a rare occurrence, so three in 18 hours would be a big coincidence,\" he said. . If the sabotage was indeed committed by Russia, this was a \"bizarre\" move, he said, as it had already shut supplies off. .

Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhaylo Podolyak said the damage to Nord Stream 1 and 2 was \"an act of aggression\" towards the EU. He added that Russia wanted to cause pre-winter panic and urged the EU to increase military support for Ukraine. Seismologists reported underwater blasts before the leaks emerged. \"There is no doubt that these were explosions,\" said Bjorn Lund of Sweden's National Seismology Centre, as quoted by local media. The operators of Nord Stream 2 warned of a loss of pressure in the pipeline on Monday afternoon. That led to a warning from Danish authorities that ships should avoid the area near the island of Bornholm. The operator of Nord Stream 1 said the undersea lines had simultaneously sustained \"unprecedented\" damage in one day. Denmark's Defence Command has released footage of the leaks which shows bubbles at the surface of the Baltic Sea near the island. The largest patch of sea disturbance is 1km (0.6 miles) in diameter, it says. \"Gas leak from NS-1 [Nord Stream 1] is nothing more than a terrorist attack planned by Russia and an act of aggression towards the EU. Russia wants to destabilise the economic situation in Europe and cause pre-winter panic,\" Ukraine's Mr Podolyak tweeted in English. He also called on European partners, particularly Germany, to increase military support for Ukraine. \"The best response and security investment are tanks for Ukraine. Especially German ones,\" he said. Other European leaders have raised the idea that the damage to the pipelines was deliberately inflicted. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki blamed it on sabotage and said it was probably linked to the war in Ukraine. . Denmark's Prime Minister, Mette Frederiksen, said it was too early to come to conclusions, but that it was hard to imagine the multiple leaks could be a coincidence. . At the same time, unconfirmed reports in German media said authorities were not ruling out an attack on the undersea gas network. . A Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said he was \"extremely concerned\" about the incident, and the possibility of a deliberate attack could not be ruled out. . The EU has previously accused Russia of using a reduction in gas supplies as an economic weapon, in response to European sanctions imposed because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. However, Moscow denies this, saying the sanctions have made it impossible to maintain the gas infrastructure properly. Whatever the cause of the damage, it will not immediately affect the supply of gas to Europe, as neither pipeline was operational. . The Nord Stream 1 pipeline - which consists of two parallel branches - has not transported any gas since August when Russia closed it down for maintenance. . It stretches 745 miles (1,200km) under the Baltic Sea from the Russian coast near St Petersburg to north-eastern Germany. Its twin pipeline, Nord Stream 2, was halted after the Russian invasion of Ukraine began. Although neither pipeline is in operation, they both still contain gas. German, Danish and Swedish authorities are all investigating the incidents. . The Danish energy authority told the Reuters news agency that the leak could continue for several days and perhaps even a week. . The pipeline's operators - Nord Stream AG - said it was impossible to estimate when the system's infrastructure would be restored. Energy prices have soared since Moscow invaded Ukraine and scarce supplies could push up costs even further. There are growing fears that families in the EU will be unable to afford the cost of heating this winter. Poland is leading the effort to curb reliance on Russia, once Europe's main energy supplier, with the inauguration of a new gas pipeline. The Baltic Pipe will be a new link for Norwegian gas to Europe, which will allow countries to the south of Poland, including Slovakia and the Czech Republic, to access it. .", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-63044747", "related_stories": ["How Russia is cutting off gas to Europe", "Leaking Russian gas pipeline poses shipping hazard", "Russia to make further cuts in gas supply to EU"], "related_topics": ["Gazprom", "Germany", "Russia", "Natural gas"]},

Queen Elizabeth II's final departure from Buckingham Palace began at 14:22 BST, when the slow-moving procession departed her former home for Westminster Hall. The Queen's four children, led by King Charles, walked behind the coffin. Nearby, Big Ben tolled at 60-second intervals throughout the Queen's 38-minute journey to the Palace of Westminster. The coffin travelled down the Mall on a gun carriage of the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery, pulled by a team of horses bearing riders in ceremonial dress. The tree-lined boulevard, which cuts through the centre of London, has witnessed countless royal events over the years, including celebrations of the Platinum Jubilee earlier this year to mark the Queen's 70 years on the throne. Members of the public lined the Mall, many wiping away tears, some clapping and cheering, as the Queen's coffin passed by. The coffin was draped in the Royal Standard, representing the Sovereign and the UK, with the Imperial State Crown resting on top. The crown - placed on a purple cushion - features the St Edward's sapphire, Black Prince's Ruby and the Cullinan II diamond, cut from the largest diamond in the world. The coffin also bore a wreath of white roses and dahlias. King Charles III was joined by his sons, Prince William, now Prince of Wales, and Prince Harry, in the solemn procession. Other senior members of the Royal Family also took part. Up to 1,000 members of the armed forces took part in the procession, including the Household Cavalry - represented by the Life Guards and the Blues and Royals. King Charles III, his siblings Princess Anne and Prince Edward, and his son, the Prince of Wales, all wore military uniform. The King's brother, Prince Andrew, and his younger son, Prince Harry, both wore suits. Prince Harry is no longer a working member of the Royal Family, having taken a decision in 2020 to step back. Prince Andrew, too, is no longer a working royal. He lost his military titles earlier this year - shortly before he settled a civil sexual assault lawsuit in the US, in which he denied any wrongdoing. The Queen Consort, the Princess of Wales, the Duchess of Sussex and the Countess of Wessex all travelled from Buckingham Palace by car, joining the King at Westminster Hall for a short service following the procession. The procession moved along Horse Guards Parade and down Whitehall to arrive at Westminster Hall at 15:00 BST. Eight young men from the Grenadier Guards were entrusted with the task of carrying the Queen's coffin into the Palace of Westminster. Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to file past the coffin to pay their respects to the Queen over the next four days - with a huge policing operation in place. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex and the Prince and Princess of Wales. James, Viscount Severn, and Lady Louise Windsor. King Charles III stands, focused on the coffin. Earlier in the day, guards waited for the Queen's coffin to emerge from Buckingham Palace. And large queues formed along the banks of the River Thames, as people waited for the Queen's lying-in-state to begin. The late Queen will lie in state inside Westminster Hall until the morning of her funeral, to be held on Monday 19 September.

He landed at Belfast City Airport - in the shadows of the famous Harland and Wolff shipyard cranes - at about 12:00 BST. King Charles and Camilla, the Queen Consort, were presented with gifts of truffles with an image of the Giant's Causeway on the tin and a bunch of flowers by Ella Smith and Lucas Watt, both aged 10, from Forge Integrated Primary School in the city. The King and Camilla travelled to Royal Hillsborough, given the prefix in 2021 due to the village's connection to the Royal Family, where people had been waiting since dawn to catch a glimpse of them. The King and Camilla spent time shaking hands and greeting those who had gathered in the main street of the village in County Down. Connie the corgi also met the King as he received flowers and cards from excited schoolchildren. Merlin the Persian cat, wearning a golden crown, was among those who lined the streets. King Charles and Camilla spent time admiring the floral tributes left outside Hillsborough Castle, the only royal residence in Northern Ireland, after the death of Queen Elizabeth II. Inside the castle the King and Camilla received a message of condolence from Northern Ireland Assembly Speaker Alex Maskey before the King made a short speech to the guests. The King also met senior Stormont politicians, including Sinn F\u00e9in vice-president Michelle O'Neill, Democratic Unionist Party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and figures from the other main parties. He was introduced to troops at the castle, shortly after a 21-gun salute had taken place in the castle gardens. Outside there were smiles and one woman (below, left) held a photo of her meeting the then Prince of Wales when she received an MBE several years ago. The Hillsborough Fort Guard also stood outside during the King's visit to the royal residence. The King and the Queen Consort made their way to St Anne's Cathedral in Belfast for a service of reflection for the life of the Queen, their last formal engagement in Northern Ireland for the day. A large crowd gathered outside Belfast City Hall to witness the King and Camilla pass through the city centre. Large screens were placed in the city centre for those who wanted to watch the service. Inside the cathedral Prime Minister Liz Truss and Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Miche\u00e1l Martin were among those who took part in the service. It was Ms Truss's first visit to Northern Ireland since she became prime minister last week and she was greeted by Michelle O'Neill from Sinn F\u00e9in, whose part is the largest in the Stormont assembly. After the service the King and Queen Consort greeted those who had gathered in Writers' Square opposite the cathedral.

Her tattoo and other intimate moments in her life have all been captured by photographer Abbie Trayler-Smith. For the past 12 years, Shannon has allowed Abbie no holds barred access to her life as she navigated the challenges of being an obese teenager and young adult. The photographs capture revealing moments, such as Shannon shopping for a plus-size prom dress and recovering from gastric balloon surgery. Shannon said when she was growing up her mother always used to say she should tell the bullies to kiss her bum and that is what inspired the tattoo. \"That was something we always laughed about when I was a kid\u2026 it kind of came from that,\" said Shannon. . In 2010 self-taught documentary and portrait photographer Abbie decided she wanted to work on something personal - a set of photographs that share the \"human experience of living with obesity\". \"I grew up as a fat teenager and I wanted to turn the camera on an issue that really means something to me,\" said Abbie, who grew up in Monmouthshire and now lives in Devon. . \"I've always felt really ashamed of being a fat teenager so it did feel really exposing but once I decided to go for it, use my own experiences to collaborate with kids and with families, it then felt really liberating and that shame kind of evaporated.\" . But finding young people to open up their lives to her in that way was always going to be a challenge. . \"How do you say to someone 'I'd like to photograph you or your child because they're overweight, and I'd like to talk about their experiences?,\" she said. Shannon, then just 14, was to be her first subject. . They met at the launch of a website about young people's health in Shannon's hometown Sheffield, where Shannon had been invited along to read a poem. . \"She said in her poem 'please don't patronise me with eat less and exercise, walk in my shoes for a day and then tell me what you think',\" recalled Abbie. . Abbie approached her about taking part and they have been working together ever since.  . \"Initially I was hesitant about the project - I was already getting bullied for being fat so why would I want to publicise it?,\" said Shannon. \"But then I thought people always perceive fat people as being miserable and self-conscious when in fact I'm a happy person\u2026 I have a really busy life and a really fun life.\" . Initially Shannon did not like looking at the photos: \"I wasn't very confident, I hated how I looked but now when I look at them I like the pictures she's taken,\" she said. . Around the world, more than 340 million children and adolescents aged five to 19 were overweight or obese in 2016, . according to World Health Organization.  (WHO). . \"It is a health issue as well, so whilst I'm very much into being positive about your body I think it's also important to find a balance between that and what's healthy,\" said Abbie. Since meeting Shannon, Abbie has photographed a number of young people, resulting in her project . The Big O. . \"The big C refers to cancer as that's a word people don't like to talk about... even now I would say that obesity is still a word that people don't like to talk about, because it is a very complex issue,\" explained Abbie. . Sam was 18 and living with her parents in Aberfan, Merthyr Tydfil, when she was photographed by Abbie for the project. Abbie had made contact with her stage school and Sam was keen to put herself forward. \"My parents were really nervous about me doing it\u2026 protective parents\u2026 God knows what people are going to say,\" she recalled. . But Sam was determined to take part, wanting to demonstrate bigger people were also in musical theatre and her parents felt more at ease after meeting Abbie. \"When I first saw the photographs I didn't know what to think,\" said Sam. \"It wasn't me posing or doing anything to make myself look smaller, it was just me - and I'd never seen that before.\" . Sam is now 26 and living in Aberdare, Rhondda Cynon Taf.  . Since the photos were taken she has been to drama school in London. She said on several occasions she had been turned away from musical theatre auditions for being both smaller and bigger than casting directors had assumed from her head shots. \"I don't think people realise how much big people are subjected to,\" she said. She has returned to Wales, become physically fit but she said her weight remained an issue, making dating harder, attracting negative comments, mostly from men, and she still yo-yo diets constantly. . But she said the biggest change in her life had been her improved confidence - something she puts down to taking part in the project. \"It was a pinnacle moment to help me accept myself - I don't think I realised how much of an impact it would have on me - all entirely positive,\" she said. \"I'm a lot more open with myself and careful with myself... \"Not all of us want to be that shy person in the corner wearing clothes that are way too big and fade into the background.\" . Cala, now 25, from Swansea, was first photographed by Abbie when she was 15. She told Abbie: \"I once fell asleep on the bus home from school and one of the boys wrote FAT on my forehead in permanent marker.\". Abbie said her work was mostly observed but on this occasion she asked Cala if they could recreate the memory and she agreed. . She said when she was taking the picture, Cala said, \"People in school told me it was me who caused the Japanese tsunami.\". Another teenager in The Big O project is Dee, 21, who was 12 when she was first photographed by Abbie. At the time Dee, from south Wales, told Abbie: \"I feel nervous going anywhere because kids these days, even littler kids, can be quite harsh... \"I don't feel comfortable in myself, because I just feel like I'm too heavy.\". She said her family had been through some tough times over the years and she  \"just found myself eating a lot\". Now Abbie, who was previously a photographer for the Daily Telegraph, is working on a photo book that will be \"an intimate photographic portrait of Shannon\". \"This book is about Shannon who I've photographed consistently over 12 years,\" said Abbie. . \"She's the one I've got the most intimate work with - she's given me no holds barred access to her life, so the image is are really powerful and really beautiful.\". She is raising funds for the production of the book Kiss It!  though a funding platform and hopes it will be published by GOST Books at the start of next year. . Shannon and Abbie have holidayed together and when Abbie visits Sheffield she stays with  Shannon's friends and family. . \"We're more friends than anything now,\" said Shannon. \"The past couple of times she's come up [to Sheffield] we've intended to take pictures and actually just ended up going out to lunch and just chatting and catching up.\". There may be a book on the way but 12 years on Abbie's self-funded project has not finished yet.  . \"I think I'll carry on photographing Shannon for a long time, if she has kids - it's quite an amazing document if she keeps on letting me,\" she said.  . \"Slow photography is what I call it, but that's enabled a really lovely relationship to build up and trust, and it's brought a real intimacy.\". Abbie has nothing but admiration for the young people she has photographed. \"To stand up say 'I'll let a photographer into my life and I'll show them who I am, and I'll allow that to be in the public arena' -  it's quite a courageous thing to do,\" she said. . \"The thing about obesity is you're wearing it on your body for everybody else to see, you can't hide it.\" .

But what has China actually achieved?. We've compared the Chinese data with global poverty figures compiled by the World Bank. Poverty is defined by China as anyone in rural areas earning less than about $2.30 a day (adjusted for inflation). It was fixed in 2010 and looks at income but also living conditions, healthcare and education. . Provinces have been racing to reach the goal. Jiangsu, for example, announced in January last year that only . 17 of its 80 million residents still lived in poverty. . . The national benchmark used by the Chinese government is slightly higher than the $1.90 a day poverty line used by the World Bank to look at poverty globally. Using these figures gives us a better standard measurement used by the World Bank across all countries. In 1990 there were more than 750 million people in China living below the international poverty line - about two-thirds of the population. By 2012, that had fallen to fewer than 90 million, and by 2016 - the most recent year for which World Bank figures are available - it had fallen to 7.2 million people (0.5% of the population). So clearly, even in 2016 China was well on the way to reaching its target. This suggests that overall, 745 million fewer people were living in extreme poverty in China than were 30 years ago. . World Bank figures do not take us to the present day, but the trend is certainly in line with the Chinese government's announcement. . Elsewhere in the region, Vietnam has also seen a dramatic fall in extreme poverty rates over a similar period. . Another large country, India, had 22% of its population living below the international poverty line in 2011 (the most recent data available). Brazil has 4.4% of its people earning less than $1.90 a day. China's rapid reduction in poverty went hand in hand with a long period of sustained economic growth. Much of the focus has been on the poorest rural areas. . The government has relocated millions of people from remote villages into apartment complexes. Sometimes these were built in towns and cities, but sometimes new villages were built near the old ones. But there has been criticism that people had little choice over whether to move homes, or jobs. Some also point out that the reason rural poverty was so widespread was because of Communist Party policies in the first place. \"There is no doubt something absolutely extraordinary has happened over the last 40 years,\" says the Economist's David Rennie. . However, this success in bringing people out of abject poverty is not simply down to the government, he says. \"Chinese people, by working extremely hard, lifted themselves out of poverty - in part because some of the stupidest economic policies ever created, by Chairman Mao, were abandoned in favour of versions of capitalism.\". Mao Zedong, who founded the People's Republic of China in 1949, oversaw attempts to industrialise the country's peasant economy in the 1950s. His disastrous Great Leap Forward, which began in 1958, forced farmers into communes, leading to . mass starvation in the countryside. . While China has made substantial work of tackling the deepest poverty first, should it be holding itself to a higher standard?. For example, the World Bank draws a higher poverty line for upper-middle-income countries, which tries to reflect economic conditions. It sets this at $5.50 a day. China is now an upper-middle-income country, says the bank. About a quarter of China's population is in poverty, according to this metric. For comparison, this is slightly higher than Brazil. And there is widespread income inequality. Last year, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said China still had 600 million people whose monthly income was barely 1,000 yuan ($154). He said that was not enough to rent a room in a city. However, by any measure China has made huge strides to lift millions out of the toughest standards of living over the last few decades.

It's a country where political twists and turns are very much guided by influential online pundits with large followings on platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. With concrete information hard to come by, misinformation and exaggeration has been the order of the day particularly as it's a very tight race between Deputy President William Ruto and long-time opposition leader Raila Odinga. So in the world of social media speculation, both candidates have already been declared the winner. . Twitter has placed labels on some posts warning users to wait for the official result. There have already been claims of politicians losing their seats only for them later to be announced as winners. As in many countries, influential bloggers and politicians in Kenya help political parties bypass mainstream media channels and connect directly with potential supporters. . For many, this has been the main source of information during the election campaigns and a means of mobilising support. Election observers and monitoring groups have expressed concern at the scale of the false and misleading information being spread. . Some posts are falsely claiming fraud at polling stations, such as this one from a Ruto supporter suggesting a voter turnout of over 100% in an area with strong traditional support for Raila Odinga. The Tweet is partially correct. There is indeed a discrepancy on the returning officer's declaration form.  . However, referring back to the official voter registration data shows that the number of registered voters should be 632 and not 362.  . The error at the local level makes no difference to the number of votes recorded, and indicates that the turnout at this polling station was about 62%. On the other side, Mr Odinga's supporters have been having a go at their opponents online. . In this Tweet, for example, a long-standing disagreement over the use of an electronic system is highlighted by pointing out that Mr Ruto's running mate, Rigathi Gachagua (whose coalition opposed the use of a manual register) had difficulties registering at a polling station using the electronic method. While the electronic kit initially had problems identifying Mr Gachagua, it eventually worked after he rubbed his finger on his hair allowing him to vote. For those trying to locate reliable sources of election information it's all too easy to fall into the trap of fake accounts pretending to be those of official electoral bodies. A Twitter account calling itself IEBC Tabulation has been posting election results and using the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission's official logo as the profile picture and cover image. To confuse further, the account linked directly to the authentic election website.  However, a deeper look quickly revealed not only clear political bias, but also that it had recently been posting a stream of sexually explicit content. This account has now been suspended for violating Twitter rules. One attempt at misleading voters appeared on election day itself, suggesting that votes had already been tallied in an overseas polling station in Sydney, Australia and that Mr Odinga had received the most votes. Variations of this message, presumably designed to energise supporters to get out and vote, circulated on WhatsApp, Twitter and Facebook. However, it was all made up. There were no Kenyan diaspora polling stations in Australia. . The electoral commission says voting by the diaspora was taking place in 12 locations: Burundi, Tanzania, Rwanda, Uganda, South Africa, United Kingdom, Canada, USA, South Sudan, Qatar, UAE, and Germany. Australia wasn't one of them.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/62495970", "related_stories": [], "related_topics": ["Fake News", "Reality Check", "Kenya general election 2022"]},

The image from 19 March, first reported by the New York Times and confirmed by the BBC, directly contradicts Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov's claim that footage of bodies in Bucha, that has emerged in recent days, was \"staged\" after the Russians withdrew.  . The satellite image shows objects that appear to be bodies in the exact locations where they were subsequently found by Ukrainian forces when they regained control of the town north of Kyiv.  . Along another section of the road, the image shows what appear to be more bodies on the ground. There is an earlier satellite image available from Maxar on 11 March. It appears to show bodies in the same locations but is less clear than the one on 19 March. Russia has made a series of unfounded claims relating to images from Bucha - here's what the evidence tells us. . Warning: This piece contains graphic images which some may find upsetting. Russia says its forces withdrew from Bucha on 30 March. The Ukrainians say this happened in the early hours of 31 March. On 1 April, footage was posted . filmed from a car . driving through the town which showed bodies on either side of a road. Russia has claimed it shows \"fake dead bodies\" and was \"staged\" after its troops left the town. We compared the car footage with the satellite imagery of Bucha from 19 March (when the Russians were in control). In both, there are bodies lying in the same parts of the road (marked in red) and near vehicles (marked in yellow). Pro-Russian social media accounts also . circulated a slowed-down version of the footage on the same road. , claiming that the arm on one of the bodies moved. . The video is grainy but a closer analysis of it shows that what is claimed to be a moving arm, is actually a mark in the bottom right corner of the vehicle's windscreen. We've circled this mark - which looks like a raindrop or a speck of dirt - along with similar marks visible on the windscreen earlier in the video. Another Russian claim focuses on a different part of the footage. The car passes another body, lying next to a pavement with red and yellow stones and shattered brown fencing. . As it drives on, the body can be seen briefly in the right-hand wing mirror. Pro-Russian accounts claim the body \"sits up\". But a slowed-down version of the video shows the wing mirror is clearly distorting the reflection of the body, as well as houses in the background. The same effect can be seen in videos of . similar wing mirrors posted on the internet. . . The BBC has matched both bodies from the video (posted on 2 April) with high-resolution photos provided by Getty Images and AFP on 3 April. In the video, the first body is lying on their back near a white and yellow kerb. The pavement to the right is part asphalt and part grass. A silver car can be seen on the pavement with its boot open in front of a white fence. . The same car, kerb, pavement and fence are visible in the Getty/AFP image. The second body has a black jacket and what appears to be a bloodied tourniquet or bandage on the right arm. They are lying on their side next to a red and yellow pavement, in front of a shattered brown fence. . The black jacket, tourniquet/bandage, pavement and fence all match the photo of the body published by Getty/AFP. A pro-Russian social media account, Rybar, says the Maxar satellite images shown in this article were not taken on 19 March - but on 1 April,  the day after Russian forces departed. Russia has made unfounded claims the killings were carried out by Ukrainians, but if the bodies were there on 19 March as the satellite images show, that cannot be the case.  At that time Russia controlled the area. Rybar says its conclusions are based on an analysis of shadows from images downloaded from the Maxar database, revealing the date and time at which the photograph was taken. We contacted Maxar, who said it appeared Rybar had used the company's image search tools wrongly, and that if correctly used, the images can clearly be shown to be from 19 March. The BBC has also checked this analysis, comparing images from three separate companies (PlanetLab, Apollo Mapping and Maxar) taken from the available satellite imagery over this period.  . We've determined that the lengths of the shadows (and therefore the angle of the sun) is consistent with the satellite images having been taken on the morning of 19 March and not on 1 April. Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs tweeted: \"It is of particular worry that all the bodies of the people whose images have been published by the Kiev regime are not stiffened after at least four days.\" . According to the Ukrainian military, the Russians left in the early hours of 31 March. The Russians say they left on 30 March. In the hours after death, bodies go through a process called rigor mortis where muscles contract and stiffen. . We asked a forensic pathologist for their opinion on whether a body would be expected to be \"stiffened\" after four days. One who has worked in places including Kosovo and Rwanda on war crimes investigations, who did not want to be named, told the BBC that by four days rigor mortis has \"usually subsided\". The Russian tweet also claimed that the bodies \"have no typical cadaver stains\". It's not clear what this means but the pathologist said the appearance of someone who has died from a gunshot wound or other act of violence will vary widely depending on the weapon used, from what distance they were shot and so on. . There isn't always a lot of visible blood as it may pool underneath people or soak into heavy clothing, especially if someone is dressed for cold weather. The tweet could be referring to the fact the blood within your body pools downwards after death as it stops circulating around the body, which can lead the skin to turn reddish or purple. . But if someone is lying down, the site of this blood pooling and discolouration may well not be visible from an image alone. The Russian defence ministry claimed that while Bucha was under Russian control \"not a single local resident has suffered from any violent action\". . This claim, however, contradicts numerous eyewitness accounts from residents. A local teacher . told Human Rights Watch . on 4 March that Russian forces had rounded up five men and summarily executed one of them. . Local residents who spoke to the Russian investigative website The Insider painted a similar picture. \"These were horrific days. When neither your courtyard, your house or even your life belongs to you. There is no electricity, water, gas. It's forbidden to leave the house, if you leave - you get shot,\" . local resident Kristina told The Insider. . . Locals told the BBC.  that the Russians had systematically broken down doors to loot flats, and, while soldiers stole valuables and food, residents were forced to sit in the cellar.

But that is rejected by China, which accuses some in the West of promoting this narrative to tarnish its image. It says: \"There is not a single country that has fallen into [a] so-called 'debt trap' as a result of borrowing from China.\". China is one of the world's largest single creditor nations. . Its loans to lower and middle-income countries have tripled over the past decade, reaching $170bn (\u00a3125bn) by the end of 2020. . However, China's overall lending commitments are likely to be significantly greater than these figures suggest. Research by AidData, an international development body at William & Mary University in the US, finds that half of China's lending to developing countries is not reported in official debt statistics. It is often kept off government balance sheets, directed to state-owned companies and banks, joint ventures or private institutions, rather than directly from government to government.  . There are now more than 40 low and middle-income countries, according to AidData, whose debt exposure to Chinese lenders is more than 10% of the size of their annual economic output (GDP) as a result of this \"hidden debt\". Djibouti, Laos, Zambia and Kyrgyzstan have debts to China equivalent to at least 20% of their annual GDP. . Much of the debt owed to China relates to large infrastructure projects like roads, railways and ports, and also to the mining and energy industry, under President Xi Jinping's . Belt and Road Initiative. .  . In an interview with the BBC, Richard Moore, the head of Britain's foreign intelligence agency MI6, said China uses what he called \"debt traps\" to gain leverage over other countries. . The claim is that China lends money to other countries, which end up having to cede control of key assets if they can't meet their debt repayments - an accusation that's been long denied by Beijing. One example often cited by critics of China is Sri Lanka, which years ago embarked on a massive port project in Hambantota with Chinese investment. . But the billion dollar project using loans and contractors from China became mired in controversy, and struggled to prove viable, .  leaving Sri Lanka saddled with growing debts. Finally, in 2017, Sri Lanka agreed to give state-owned China Merchants a controlling 70% stake in the port on a 99-year lease in return for further Chinese investment. . Analysis of the port project by UK-based think tank Chatham House . has questioned whether the \"debt trap\" narrative strictly applies. , given that the deal was driven by local political motivations, and that China never took formal ownership of the port. It points out that a large proportion of Sri Lanka's overall debt was owed to non-Chinese lenders, and that there's no evidence China has taken advantage of its position to gain strategic military advantage from the port. Despite that, there's little doubt China's economic involvement in Sri Lanka has grown in the past decade, and concerns persist that this could be used to advance its political ambitions in the region. There are other parts of the world where Chinese lending has also proved controversial, with contracts whose terms could give China leverage over important assets. But there are no cases, among the hundreds of loan arrangements studied by AidData and some other researchers, of Chinese state-owned lenders actually seizing a major asset in the event of a loan default. China does not publish records of its foreign loans, and the majority of its contracts contain non-disclosure clauses which prevent borrowers from revealing their contents. . It argues that such confidentiality is common practice.  for international loan contracts. \"Confidentiality agreements are very common in international commercial loans\", says Professor Lee Jones at Queen Mary University of London. . \"And much of China's development financing is fundamentally a commercial operation.\". Most of the major industrialised nations share information about their lending activities through membership of what's known as the Paris Club.  . China has chosen not to join this grouping, but using available World Bank data, the rapid growth in China's reported lending compared to others can be clearly observed. China tends to lend at higher rates of interest than western governments. At around 4%, these loans are close to commercial market rates and about four times that of a typical loan from the World Bank or an individual country such as France or Germany. The required repayment period for a Chinese loan is also generally shorter - less than 10 years, compared to around 28 years for other lenders' concessional loans to developing countries. Chinese state-owned lenders also typically require borrowers to maintain a minimum cash balance in an offshore account to which the lender has access. . \"If a borrower fails to repay its debt,\" says Brad Parks, Executive Director of AidData, \"China can simply debit funds from [this] account without having to collect on bad debt through a judicial process.\". This approach is rarely seen in loans issued by western lenders. There's currently an initiative by G20 nations - those countries which have the largest and fastest-growing economies - to offer debt relief for poorer countries to help them deal with the impact of the pandemic. . China has joined this and says it has contributed \"the highest amount of debt repayment\" of any country taking part in the plan. The World Bank says that since May 2020, a total of more than $10.3bn has been delivered in debt relief by G20 countries under this scheme. But when we asked the World Bank for a breakdown by country, it said it could not share the information.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/59585507", "related_stories": [], "related_topics": ["China", "Reality Check"]},

The fear that a vaccine will somehow change your DNA is one we've seen aired regularly on social media. The BBC asked three independent scientists about this. They said that the coronavirus vaccine would not alter human DNA. Some of the newly created vaccines, including . the one now approved in the UK developed by Pfizer/BioNTech,.  use a fragment of the virus's genetic material - or messenger RNA. \"Injecting RNA into a person doesn't do anything to the DNA of a human cell,\" says Prof Jeffrey Almond of Oxford University. . It works by giving the body instructions to produce a protein which is present on the surface of the coronavirus. . The immune system then learns to recognise and produce antibodies against the protein. . This isn't the first time we've looked into claims that a coronavirus vaccine will supposedly alter DNA. . We investigated a popular video spreading the theory.  back in May. . Posts have noted that messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine technology \"has never been tested or approved before\". . It is true that no mRNA vaccine has been approved before now, but multiple studies of mRNA vaccines in humans have taken place over the last few years. And, since the pandemic started, the vaccine has been tested on tens of thousands of people around the world and has gone through a rigorous safety approval process.  . Like all new vaccines, it has to undergo rigorous safety checks before it can be recommended for widespread use. In Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials, vaccines are tested in small numbers of volunteers to check they are safe and to determine the right dose. . In Phase 3 trials they are tested in thousands of people to see how effective they are. The group who received the vaccine and a control group who have received a placebo are closely monitored for any adverse reactions - side-effects. Safety monitoring continues after a vaccine has been approved for use. Next, a conspiracy theory that has spanned the globe. It claims that the coronavirus pandemic is a cover for a plan to implant trackable microchips and that the Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates is behind it. There is no vaccine \"microchip\" and there is no evidence to support claims that Bill Gates is planning for this in the future. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation told the BBC the claim was \"false\". Rumours took hold in March when Mr Gates said in an interview that eventually \"we will have some digital certificates\" which would be used to show who'd recovered, been tested and ultimately who received a vaccine. He made no mention of microchips. This led to one widely shared article headlined: \"Bill Gates will use microchip implants to fight coronavirus.\". The article makes reference to a study, funded by The Gates Foundation, into a technology that could store someone's vaccine records in a special ink administered at the same time as an injection. However, the technology is not a microchip and is more like an invisible tattoo. It has not been rolled out yet, would not allow people to be tracked and personal information would not be entered into a database, says Ana Jaklenec, a scientist involved in the study. The billionaire founder of Microsoft has been the subject of many false rumours during the pandemic. . He's been targeted because of his philanthropic work in public health and vaccine development. . Despite the lack of evidence, in May a . YouGov poll of 1,640 people.  suggested 28% of Americans believed Mr Gates wanted to use vaccines to implant microchips in people - with the figure rising to 44% among Republicans. We've seen claims that vaccines contain the lung tissue of an aborted fetus. This is false. \"There are no fetal cells used in any vaccine production process,\" says Dr Michael Head, of the University of Southampton. One particular video that was posted on one of the biggest anti-vaccine Facebook pages refers to a study which the narrator claims is evidence of what goes into the vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University. But the narrator's interpretation is wrong - the study in question explored how the vaccine reacted when introduced to human cells in a lab. Confusion may have arisen because there is a step in the process of developing a vaccine that uses cells grown in a lab, which are the descendants of embryonic cells that would otherwise have been destroyed. The . technique was developed in the 1960s. , and no fetuses were aborted for the purposes of this research. Many vaccines are made in this way, explains Dr David Matthews, from Bristol University, adding that any traces of the cells are comprehensively removed from the vaccine \"to exceptionally high standards\". The developers of the vaccine at Oxford University say they worked with cloned cells, but these cells \"are not themselves the cells of aborted babies\". The cells work like a factory to manufacture a greatly weakened form of the virus that has been adapted to function as a vaccine. But even though the weakened virus is created using these cloned cells, this cellular material is removed when the virus is purified and not used in the vaccine. We've seen arguments against a Covid-19 vaccine shared across social media asking why we need one at all if the chances of dying from the virus are so slim. A meme shared by people who oppose vaccination put the recovery rate from the disease at 99.97% and suggested getting Covid-19 is a safer option than taking a vaccine. To begin with, the figure referred to in the meme as the \"recovery rate\" - implying these are people who caught the virus and survived - is not correct. About 99.0% of people who catch Covid survive it, says Jason Oke, senior statistician at the University of Oxford. So around 100 in 10,000 will die - far higher than three in 10,000, as suggested in the meme. However, Mr Oke adds that \"in all cases the risks very much depend on age and do not take into account short and long-term morbidity from Covid-19\". It's not just about survival. For every person who dies, there are others who live through it but undergo intensive medical care, and those who suffer . long-lasting health effects. . This can contribute to a health service overburdened with Covid patients, competing with a hospital's limited resources to treat patients with other illnesses and injuries. Concentrating on the overall death rate, or breaking down the taking of a vaccine to an individual act, misses the point of vaccinations, says Prof Liam Smeeth of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. It should be seen as an effort by society to protect others, he says. \"In the UK, the worst part of the pandemic, the reason for lockdown, is because the health service would be overwhelmed. Vulnerable groups like the old and sick in care homes have a much higher chance of getting severely ill if they catch the virus\".

We've checked some of the things he said. President Putin has repeatedly said Ukraine plans to acquire nuclear weapons as a justification for Russia's invasion, although there's no evidence this is the case. When it was part of the former Soviet Union, Ukraine did have nuclear weapons, but gave these up in the 1990s in return for security guarantees from the US, UK and Russia. Last year, the Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, suggested if Ukraine couldn't join Nato, it might have to reconsider its nuclear-free status. . \"Either we are part of an alliance such as Nato... or we have the only option - to arm by ourselves, and maybe think about nuclear status again.\". However, the Ukrainian government has not expressed an intention to acquire nuclear weapons and a military strategy document published last year did not refer to them. A report by the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists in March noted that even if Ukraine wanted nuclear weapons, it would face major logistical and technical challenges . in creating weapons-grade nuclear material and having the means to deliver it. It would also mean Ukraine breaking its obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which it joined in 1994. This bars countries which don't have nuclear weapons from acquiring them. The UN's nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), says it has seen no signs in Ukraine \"of the diversion of nuclear material, intended for peaceful activities, for other purposes.\". President Putin has frequently claimed the presence of neo-Nazis in Ukraine as a justification for Russia's invasion. At the last parliamentary election in 2019, support for far-right candidates was just 2% - far lower than in many other European countries.  . Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky is Jewish and members of his family died in the Holocaust. . In the 2019 presidential election which Mr Zelensky won, the main far-right candidate won just 1.6% of the vote. But there have been far-right groups in Ukraine -  the most high-profile is the Azov regiment - elements of which have expressed support for Nazi ideology.  . It was formed to resist Russian-backed separatists, who seized areas of eastern Ukraine in 2014, and was subsequently absorbed as a unit within the Ukrainian military. The term \"Banderites\" refers to supporters of the World War Two nationalist leader Stepan Bandera, who expressed anti-Semitic views and for a time collaborated with Nazi Germany. . He remains a highly controversial figure in Ukraine, some hailing him as a patriotic nationalist, others condemning him for his Nazi sympathies. President Putin appears to be suggesting, not only that Nato has been expanding its influence in the Baltic states which are Nato members - but also inside Ukraine, which is not in Nato. It's true that Nato allies have supported Ukraine with equipment and training since 2014, and they have deployed more forces to some Nato member states in eastern Europe. . Nato stepped up assistance to Ukraine following the annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014, and military trainers from Nato member states have had a presence in the country. . The US had around 150 military trainers in Ukraine (whom it pulled out in February as the threat of a Russian invasion grew), and the UK had at one point a similar number, with other countries having smaller training missions. The US and the UK had supplied limited numbers of anti-tank weapons to Ukraine before the war started, but it's clear that there has been much more foreign military aid flowing to Ukraine in response to Russia's invasion. Nato says that its deployments in eastern Europe after 2014 - four battle groups in the Baltic states and Poland - . amounted to only 5,000 troops.  \"Before Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea, there were no allied troops in the eastern part of the [Nato] alliance,\" it says. It also says that further Nato military activity in eastern Europe has been in response to Russia's own build up near Ukraine, which went on for many weeks before it invaded in late February. . At one point, the Russian forces . were estimated to be anything between 100,000 and 190,000 strong. . Read more from Reality Check.

Vasyl Bodnar says \"We have full co-operation. The ship is currently standing at the entrance to the port, it has been detained by the customs authorities of Turkey\". We've tracked the Russian-flagged ship, the Zhibek Zholy, on its route from the Ukrainian port of Berdyansk, to Karasu on the Turkish Black Sea coast. It is not clear where its cargo came from or how it was obtained, but Russia has been accused of stealing grain from areas of Ukraine it controls - allegations Russia denies. Berdyansk is in Ukraine's southern Zaporizhzhia region, on the Sea of Azov. . News of the ship's departure from Berdyansk was announced on social media app Telegram by Yevhen Balytskyi, who was recently appointed by Russia as governor of the occupied areas of Zaporizhzhia. Mr Balytskyi said 7,000 tonnes of grain would be sent to \"friendly\" countries. He added that ships from Russia's Black Sea Fleet would be \"ensuring the security\" of the journey, and that the port had been cleared of sea mines. He later edited the post, taking out references to the ship's cargo and destination. . A video news report about the departure of the ship has also been shared on several pro-Kremlin Telegram channels showing it along with a Russian naval vessel in a harbour, which was identified as Berdyansk by the reporter. . Comparing the video footage with satellite imagery of the port, we have been able to confirm that it was filmed in Berdyansk.  . The weather conditions in the video and the angle of the shadows along the harbour suggest it was filmed on the morning of 28 June. Some features along the ship's hull, such as its name, were blurred out in the video. But we have confirmed that the ship that left Berdyansk is the same one now lying off the Turkish coast, based on images from the Telegram posts as well as eyewitness accounts given to a Ukrainian shipping expert. We have also been able to track the earlier movements of the Zhibek Zholy as it made its way towards Ukraine to pick up its cargo. On 22 June it travelled from Turkey, dropping off its cargo at the Russian port of Novorossiysk.  As it then approached the Ukrainian coast, its tracking signal was lost - suggesting it had been switched off. . The signal only reappeared on 29 June as it headed back south away from the Ukrainian coast. This tracker also reports the depth at which the ship lies in the water - and it indicated that the ship had taken on cargo. . Michelle Bockmann, a markets editor at Lloyd's List Intelligence, believes this is \"suspicious\" behaviour. . She says many cargo ships turn off their trackers for part of their journeys in the Sea of Azov, but most resume their transmissions when they reach their intended port. It's not clear whether the ship intends to unload its cargo in the Turkish port of Karasu or continue its journey south through the Bosphorus Strait to an, as yet, unknown destination. . The registered owner of the Zhibek Zholy, a Kazakh-based company called KTZ Express, has told the Reuters news agency that the ship has been chartered by a Russian company.

Scientists say warmer and drier seasons are likely to become the norm, but have these past few months been the driest on record?. One measure of drought conditions used by scientists is based on the level of moisture in the soil as measured by satellite imagery. . We have compared these dry conditions over the past three months to average conditions since the beginning of this century, to build up a picture of how extreme recent weather patterns have been. This data is based on both soil conditions and temperature data to create what is known as a soil moisture anomaly map. We can see that most of Europe has experienced much drier weather this summer than the average for the period 2001 to 2016. Elsewhere, the west of China has been very dry, with many areas experiencing extreme drought. Parts of sub-Saharan Africa and the US are also experiencing critically dry conditions. In Europe, this summer's drought may be the worst the continent has experienced in 500 years, . according to the EU's environmental programme Copernicus. At the peak of the dry spell in late August, almost half of Europe suffered from a \"soil moisture deficit\". Scientists say climate change means Europe will continue to experience more frequent and persistent droughts, and the dry conditions this year have affected agriculture, transport and energy generation. The Rhine, a major river and cargo route, dropped to critically low levels this summer, . causing shipping disruption. The period between June and August was the hottest on record, and a . report by the EU in August.  predicted at least three more months of \"warmer and drier\" days. Europe has experienced droughts in the past, but recent years have seen increasingly hot summers with many high temperature records set. \"We have now had consecutive droughts for the last five years, and this year is the worst Europe-wide drought in hundreds of years,\" says Dr Fred Hattermann, of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. \"It's not just less rain, it's also that it's got much warmer, so the overall soil moisture has decreased.\". This summer, China experienced an extended period of high temperatures that lasted more than two months, the longest since records began in the 1960s, according to China's Meteorological Administration. Extreme heat and a severe lack of rainfall meant China's biggest river, the Yangtze, shrank. During August, there was 60% less rainfall in the river's drainage area than normal, according to official Chinese data. Despite large areas in southern China struggling with drought, heavy rains in northern areas led to flooding. The Liao River in northern China recorded its second highest water level since 1961. . And nationwide, rainfall has steadily increased since 2012, China's annual climate change study says. In July, the Chinese government issued eight drought warnings and more than 13,000 heavy rain warnings. In 2019, there were more than 28 drought warnings and 10,000 heavy rain warnings for the same period. Seeing both extreme wet and dry conditions is a feature of climate change across the globe. \"When areas of drought grow, like in Siberia and western US, that water falls elsewhere in a smaller area, worsening flooding,\" Peter Gleick, a water specialist from the US National Academy of Sciences, says. Drought conditions in eastern Ethiopia, northern Kenya and Somalia have led the UN to warn that some . 22 million people could be at risk of starvation. \"We are now in the third year of very low rainfall coupled with high temperatures in that part of the continent,\" . according to Oxfam. In Somalia, the rainfall in the March to May season was the lowest in the last six decades. And large parts of DR Congo and Uganda have also experienced very dry conditions compared with the average. But measurements of soil moisture also show how in some countries, such as South Sudan, Mauritania and Senegal, there has been severe flooding. Many parts of southern Africa have also experienced much higher than normal levels of rainfall. A World Bank report in 2021.  noted that overall \"relative to 1970-79, the numbers of droughts and floods were nearly threefold and tenfold respectively, by 2010-19\". Drought conditions in the western US have become the norm, with the region experiencing years of drier and hotter weather. In a . report published in February,.  scientists said the last two decades had seen the most extreme drought conditions in 1,200 years in the American west. And this summer, hot and dry weather led to forest fires in several states and water storage levels dropping. Lake Powell, the second largest reservoir in the US which straddles Arizona and Utah, . is at its lowest level since it was filled in the 1960s, according to Nasa. Climate models predict that the region will continue to have far less rainfall than average in the coming decades. Reporting by Tural Ahmedzade, Jake Horton, Peter Mwai and Wanyuan Song.

Speaking for the Taliban at the time, Zabihullah Mujahid made a number of pledges for the new government. . So has the regime lived up to its promises?. The previous Taliban regime, in the 1990s, severely curtailed women's freedom - and since the takeover of power by the Taliban last year, a series of restrictions have been re-imposed on women in Afghanistan. . Regulations on clothing and laws forbidding access to public areas without a male guardian have been enforced.  . In March, schools re-opened for a new academic year, but the Taliban reversed an earlier promise and girls are currently not permitted to attend secondary school. . The Taliban has blamed a lack of female teachers and the need to arrange the segregation of facilities. This has affected . an estimated 1.1 million pupils, according to the UN.  and has provoked widespread international criticism. . Primary school education for girls has been permitted. . Some public universities reopened for both men and women in February. But women's participation in the labour force has dropped since the Taliban takeover last summer, according to the World Bank. . Female participation in the labour force had increased from 15% to 22% in just over a decade, between 1998 and 2019. . However, with the Taliban imposing more restrictions on women's movements outside the home since their return to power, the percentage of females working in Afghanistan . shrank to 15% in 2021. . An . Amnesty report in July.  said that the Taliban had \"decimated the rights of women and children\" in Afghanistan.  It highlighted the abuse and torture meted out to some women who had taken part in protests against the new restrictions imposed on them. In June, the UN Security Council reported the Afghan economy had contracted by an estimated 30%-40% since the Taliban takeover in August last year. An assessment by the official body that oversees US-funded reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan concluded that although some international aid continues to flow into the country, economic conditions remain \"dire.\". The suspension of most international aid and the freezing of access to Afghanistan's foreign exchange reserves has had serious economic consequences for the country. . To compensate, the Taliban have sought to increase tax revenue, as well as ramping up coal exports to take advantage of higher global prices.  . A three-month budget announced in January this year showed the Taliban had collected nearly $400 million in domestic revenue between September and December 2021. But experts have raised concerns over the lack of transparency in how these figures were collated. The loss of international support, security challenges, climate-related issues and global food inflation are all contributing to a rapidly deteriorating economic situation. . The Taliban's pledge to tackle opium poppy cultivation mirrors a policy they introduced . with some success.  when they were last in power more than two decades ago. Opium is used to make heroin - and Afghanistan has been, by far, the world's largest source of opium for many years. In April this year, the Taliban announced a ban on the growing of poppies. There's no firm data on how the clampdown has been progressing, although reports from some poppy-growing areas in Helmand province in the south suggest . the Taliban have been forcing farmers to destroy poppy fields. A US official report in July noted that although the Taliban risked losing support from farmers and others involved in the drug trade, they \"appear committed to their narcotics ban\". However, Dr David Mansfield, an expert on Afghanistan's drug economy, points out the main opium poppy crop would already have been harvested by the time the ban was imposed. . \"The second [annual] crop in south-western Afghanistan is typically a small crop... so its destruction... will not have had a significant impact,\" says Dr Mansfield. It's also worth noting that the production and manufacture of other drugs, such as crystal meth, has been growing, . although the Taliban have banned a wild plant (ephedra) used to make it. Although the conflict which brought the Taliban to power is largely over, there were still over 2,000 civilian casualties (700 deaths and over 1,400 injuries) reported between August last year to mid-June this year, . according to UN data. . However, these figures are well down on previous years when the conflict was at its height. . Around 50% of the casualties since August 2021 were attributed to the actions of the Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) group, a branch of the Islamic State group still active in Afghanistan. In recent months, several IS-K attacks have taken place targeting civilians, especially in urban areas with Shia Muslim or other minority populations. . The presence of other anti-Taliban forces, such as the National Resistance Front (NRF) and Afghanistan Freedom Front (AFF), has also grown.  . \"The overall security environment is becoming increasingly unpredictable,\" said the UN in June, citing the presence of at least a dozen separate militant group opposed to the Taliban who are present in the country. There has also been a significant increase in human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings, detentions and torture by the Taliban, according to the UN.  . Between August 2021 and June 2022, it recorded at least 160 extrajudicial killings of former government and security force officials.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/62469204", "related_stories": [], "related_topics": ["War in Afghanistan (2001-present)", "Afghanistan", "Taliban", "Reality Check"]},

Germany, Europe's largest economy, was the largest importer in 2021, followed by Italy. In 2021, the UK imported 4% of its needs from Russia, and in June this year, it . imported no Russian gas for the third month in a row. The US doesn't import any gas from Russia. . However, they are affected when Russia restricts supplies to mainland Europe, as this causes global gas prices to rise. . Since February, . the EU has imposed a number of sanction packages on Russia. , including on its energy industry. The Kremlin has said that \"technological problems\" caused by Western sanctions are preventing Russia from supplying gas via the Nord Stream pipeline. It says . a leak has been detected in a turbine. . But a spokesperson for the EU told the BBC the sanctions regime does not affect the technology needed for the transport of gas into Europe. Siemens Energy, which produces the gas turbines, said these type of leaks \"do not normally affect the operation of a turbine\". \"This doesn't seem like a legitimate reason to close a pipeline\", says Ben McWilliams, an energy policy expert at Bruegel. \"I'm as confident as I can be that this is Putin's latest move to manipulate gas prices and put pressure on Europe's energy systems.\". Gazprom has also said missing documents have prevented certain gas turbines being maintained - but Siemens Energy has rejected the suggestion it failed to provide the relevant paperwork. The EU has proposed a price cap on Russian gas. President Putin has threatened to cut off all energy supplies if it takes such a step. The EU has also said it will . cut gas imports from Russia by two-thirds.  within a year, but has stopped short of a total ban. .

The EU has agreed to . ban all Russian oil imports which come in by sea by the end of this year. . . It will allow oil to continue to be imported by pipeline, as a \"temporary measure\" because countries like Hungary and Slovakia depend on it.

Lithuania and Finland got about 80% of their oil from Russia in November last year, the latest data available. However, EU countries can buy oil from other producers.

We've been looking into aspects of the legal case Mr Odinga has presented. A key part of Raila Odinga's case hinges on the role of the chair of the Independent Election and Boundaries Commission (IEBC), Wafula Chebukati. Mr Odinga says he should not have announced William Ruto as the winner without the agreement of a majority of the commission, and thus \"usurped\" their role. We know that four of the seven commissioners did not support the announcement of the result. But there are different interpretations of Mr Chebukati's powers. . Some experts say that under the constitution, he alone is empowered to announce the outcome of the presidential poll, acting as the returning officer for that vote. They also point to the fact that he has a legal obligation to do so within seven days of the date of the election. Mr Chebukati announced the results on 15 August, six days after the vote. However, others argue that under Kenya's election rules, Mr Chebukati can only announce what the commission itself has \"tallied and verified\", something Mr Odinga says did not happen. This is a point that the Supreme Court will have to resolve. Mr Odinga's lawyers have filed testimony from anti-corruption campaigner John Githongo, in which he claims to have evidence of widespread, systematic manipulation of the computerised results database. Mr Githongo says a source approached him with evidence that a team of more than 50 people worked to digitally alter results from counting stations in Mr Ruto's favour before uploading them onto the election commission website. Mr Githongo says one of those involved was Dennis Itumbi, a digital strategist working for the declared winner of the election, William Ruto. Reacting to the accusation on Twitter, Mr Itumbi has said: \"The Fiction presented as a serious case! I am reading about myself in what sounds like a wild novel.\". To verify if tampering of the declaration documents has taken place, the forms lodged with the electoral commission will have to be compared with the original hard copies of the forms completed by returning officers at local counting stations. Mr Odinga's legal complaint also highlights what he says are inconsistencies in the official number of people who voted and the percentage given by the election officials for the overall turnout. . Mr Chebukati had initially announced a turnout of 65.4%. Mr Odinga says this turnout figure would mean 14.5m voters must have cast their ballots, based on the total number of registered voters.  . The final official number of valid votes was 14.2m (and even if you add spoiled votes, you would get only around 14.3 million ballots cast), so Mr Odinga's legal team is claiming that \"the commission is unable to account for over 250,000 votes that were cast in the election excluding voters who voted manually.\" . Mr Odinga's sums are correct. However, he's using a figure (65.4%) that Mr Chebukati shortly afterwards corrected to 64.6% - a figure which much more accurately reflects the actual voter turnout. So Mr Odinga can argue that the election commissioner initially made a mistake, but this was quickly corrected by Mr Chebukati on the same day.  . The final official turnout, once all the votes were tallied and verified, was 64.8% of the electorate. On election day, voters were not just electing a new president. They were also voting for governors, senators, MPs, women's representatives and members of county assemblies. Mr Odinga says there were unexplained discrepancies in the total number of votes cast for different positions in the same areas. . He has cited Kirinyaga County in central Kenya, where he claims some 23,000 more people voted for the president than for the governor. We can't be sure where Mr Odinga's figures have come from, or what might account for the difference. But a live stream of the count shows that the returning officer failed to mention just over 22,000 votes for one of the candidates standing in the governor's election. . We confirmed this with a reporter who witnessed the count. In other areas, Mr Odinga's team claims the votes for the president were actually lower than than those for other positions, which they say \"is a practically improbable scenario.\". Variations in the numbers of spoiled ballots might account for some of the difference.  Also, prisoners are only allowed to vote for the president - and not for any other positions - but that wouldn't make a huge difference. There may well turn out to be significant discrepancies, but at this stage it's not possible to identify these with any certainty as not all the data are available from the election commission. .", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/62632383", "related_stories": [], "related_topics": ["Kenya", "Raila Odinga", "Reality Check", "Kenya general election 2022"]},

He travelled to the west coast of the world's largest island last year after getting a phone call from the makers of Frozen Planet during lockdown. His job was to film huge blocks of ice breaking off the gigantic Store Glacier in a process called calving. The footage was to help show the scale of how Greenland's vast ice sheet was melting due to warmer temperatures in polar regions. Greenland's west side is often shrouded in fog and there were a few days of waiting around before Raymond got the call to say that the weather was good enough for filming. \"We threw everything into a helicopter and headed out,\" says Raymond. \"We could soon see some of the icebergs that had already come off the glacier and then the glacier itself - it's absolutely enormous. \"The front of the Store Glacier is 5km wide and flying quite close we could see bits falling off.\". The experience caused mixed emotions for Raymond. He says: \"At the glacier it is a very visual representation of what climate change looks like. \"It's quite an easy way to show that more ice is falling off and the glacier is calving at a faster rate because of climate change. \"But it is quite a conflicting feeling. \"You want the ice to fall off so you can film it, because a lot of effort has gone into you being there - but then you are witnessing climate change in action. It's a kind of bittersweet feeling.\". It was also unusual for Raymond because did not film any animals, the usual subject for his filming and photography. He is more used to lying in wait for hours to capture images of an elusive creature. After university and time working as a newspaper photographer, Raymond started to pursue his passions for photography and the natural world in the late 1990s. He started out filming in Scotland for programmes like Natural World and Highlands - Scotland's Wild Heart. That led to jobs on the BBC's Spring, Autumn and Winterwatch shows. \"Once you're more established people trust you to go abroad to shoot sequences,\" says Raymond. \"So, especially in the last couple of years, I've been shooting various films in Africa, Northern Europe, China and Sri Lanka.\". He adds: \"But people don't believe me when I say I am as happy to see an otter on the shore in Orkney as I am happy to see a forest elephant or a lion. \"It is still an animal and it is the behaviour of that animal that really interests me.\". Raymond says he has seen the effects of climate change in Scotland's wild places.

Claims have also appeared on Russian television and social media channels that Nato troops are actively involved in the war. Nato member countries have been providing weaponry and logistical support, but have said they aren't sending troops into Ukraine, which is not a member of the alliance. We've looked at the evidence provided for these claims of Nato boots on the ground in Ukraine. In his national address on 21 September, President Putin said: \"The Kyiv regime has launched new gangs of foreign mercenaries and nationalists, military units trained to Nato standards and under the de-facto command of Western advisers.\". It's well known that . foreign fighters have joined Ukrainian military units. .  However, claims are being made by Russian officials and media outlets of serving Nato troops on the ground in Ukraine. On 13 September, Ruslan Ostashko, the host of Vremya Pokazhet (Time Will Tell) on Russia's Channel One said: \"In the grand scheme of things, Ukrainian soldiers are there more for appearances, for having photos taken and uploading videos to TikTok, but it's mainly Nato troops fighting there.\" . Throughout the programme, footage taken from social media of foreigners allegedly fighting in Ukraine was shown as \"evidence\" of Nato boots on the ground. Andrei Marochko, a military spokesman for the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic (LPR) in the east of Ukraine, . told Russian state-owned news agency RIA Novosti. : \"Our intelligence agencies revealed the arrival of regular Nato officers in the Kharkiv region. \"The purpose of their trip to this area is to organise interaction between foreign and Ukrainian units.\". Mr Marochko has also told Russian state TV that Nato officers have arrived in Kramatorsk, a city in the Donetsk region of Ukraine. Other claims are more generally about the presence of foreign fighters and don't make the direct connection to Nato - but leave the link implied. . For example, Vladimir Kornilov, a columnist for RIA Novosti, has said there had been a \"dramatic increase in video footage of people who've come to 'liberate' Izyum, with English being spoken.\". It's important to make a clear distinction between those foreign fighters who've travelled independently to Ukraine and troops deployed by Nato member countries. Russian media outlets haven't provided evidence of serving Nato personnel on the ground, only pointing to the presence of individual foreign fighters on the battlefield. . One of the fighters shown on the Vremya Pokazhet television programme is Malcolm Nance, a former US naval officer, who has  regularly posted videos of himself in Ukraine over recent months. One video, highlighted in the TV programme, shows Mr Nance with an artillery battery behind him, firing what he describes as \"the first artillery shot of a massive combined arms, multi-axis ground offensive.\". With over a million followers on Twitter, there's very little that could be considered covert about Mr Nance's presence in Ukraine. . He is not currently serving in the US military and back in April, he shared online that he had joined the Ukrainian Foreign Legion. . A second individual identified in pro-Russian social media posts is another American, Rob-Roy Lane, who grew up in the US state of Idaho. . Mr Lane also regularly posts online videos of himself embedded with a Ukrainian military unit and names several other foreign volunteers in the team. These videos have been widely shared on pro-Russian social media channels. There's no online evidence to suggest he has any previous military experience. The US Department of Defense has not responded to requests for comment about his involvement with American military forces. On his social media account, Mr Lane names several other members in his unit including two British nationals. . \u200b\u200bThe UK's Ministry of Defence said it would not comment on the service records of former personnel, or on their activities in conflict zones. Nato member countries are providing large quantities of . sophisticated weaponry and logistical support to Ukraine. , with the United States by far the largest donor.  . This equipment includes several weapon systems which are believed to have played key roles in the conflict so far, such as long-range rocket launchers and anti-tank weapons. And there has also been Western media speculation that Nato members have been helping both with intelligence and the selection of military targets. There are around 40,000 Nato troops stationed in alliance member countries in the region, such as in the Baltic states and Poland, with another 300,000 troops on high alert in response to Russia's invasion. Extensive training of Ukrainian forces by Nato members has been taking place outside the country, but no Nato member country has said it has contributed military personnel to fight in Ukraine. \"There is no evidence of Nato ground forces participating in Ukraine,\" says Edward Arnold at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), a defence and security think tank. . \"Nor of Nato commanders directing Ukrainian units on the battlefield,\" he adds. \"There is also a very low likelihood of this happening in the future as Nato seeks to mitigate escalation risks.\".

Strictly's back!. Anton Du Beke returns to the judging panel but this time it's on a permanent basis as he officially takes over the reins from Bruno Tonioli. Despite being a bundle of energy, the Italian has clearly decided that the jetlag from bombing back and forth between LA (where he films Dancing with the Stars) and London is too much even for him. Anton will again be joined by head judge Shirley Ballas plus Motsi Mabuse and the . fab-u-lous . Craig Revel Horwood. . The launch show is on Friday, . having been delayed due to the Queen's death.  earlier in the month. To whet your appetite, here's what the celebrity contestants revealed just as they were beginning rehearsals. The actress's husband was supposed to drop her suitcase off to the hotel but he was late and she finished her first sweaty dance practice ahead of schedule. . \"I had no clothes, no change of underwear, nothing!,\" she says. \"Jayde [Adams] got something for me to borrow, and a Deliveroo.\". Having faced Nasty Nigel on Popstars back in the day. , Kym can't be worried about Craig, surely?. \"Nothing can be worse than that, to be called fat on television. How lovely! But I think [Craig] will be dreadful,\" she jokes. The singer says Strictly training is very different to prepping performances as a solo artist. \"The biggest hindrance... is we're not told [as solo performers] 'you must put your foot there, leave it there. You must move this way. You must do this.' The reason we didn't want proper jobs is because we don't like to be told what to do on stage. And when you do it for so long, it's a hard habit to break. So you're attempting to move in a certain way [in training] but you are strictly regimented with that choreography.\". Matt is back home in the UK after 11 years as a headliner in Las Vegas but says he \"wasn't happy at the end. I felt disconnected\". \"I made a decision after the success of my last record, I'm coming back to the UK. Strictly called and I thought, if I don't do this I'm going to go back to my comfort zone of just working,\" says the former Bros star, who says the first person he told was his twin brother Luke. \"I want to go disco-tastic, Staying Alive! And I want to do James Bond,\" he adds. Strictly, over to you!. The wildlife presenter and camera operator did a documentary with the man of the cloth, who took part in Strictly in 2017. \"He's an amazing dude,\" says Hamza. \"He said: 'Enjoy every single moment. If you don't normally wear Lycra - and they're gonna ask you to wear Lycra - do it, because you're gonna look sexy in it!'\". Hamza says being on the show is a win already. \"I'm severely dyslexic. So to know that someone that has dyslexia as severe as me is on TV being successful, that's amazing.\". The A-list movie star is a fan of The Great Pottery Showdown. , which comedian and actress Ellie co-presents. So is she hoping for a video message from the man himself?. \"I'm sure Brad Pitt will just slip into my DMs and say 'I loved you!',\" she laughs. Ellie adds that, having done a Strictly sketch on The Mash Report, it feels surreal to now be appearing in the real thing. \"You walk into the ballroom and think, 'My god, I'm here and it's Shirley Ballas!'. \"It's mad. It feels like you've just jumped into the telly.\". The Alma's Not Normal star has no concerns about being dismissed as a novelty act because she's a comic. \"Well, I hope I am! I sing, I dance, I act, I do funnies. I've always wanted to be a bit of a Bristolian Bette Midler.\". Jayde will be partnered with a woman this series and is looking forward to experimenting. \"Whenever you have partnerships where you have a plus size guy [with a female professional], it's easy for him because he can always lift the girl but when you have it the other way round, you have that imbalance. The [professional] guys are great they're not rugby players. So I just thought I'd be able to get into all the acrobatics.\". On who will lead and who will follow, she says: \"I think we might mix it up a bit.\". The Radio 2 travel presenter will be missing one big Strictly tradition this year. \"Every year I have a big cocktail party at my house on launch night,\" he explains. \"So my mum's fuming [that there won't be one this year]! I make a Charleston cocktail, it's like a blackcurrant liqueur. I'll give you the recipe!\". The Strictly super-fan is dancing with a male partner. \"It was a no-brainer [choosing to dance with a same sex partner]. I wish as a gay teenager\u2026 I could have switched on primetime television on a Saturday night and seen two men dancing together.\". The Paralympic swimming star has been finding her feet both on set and behind the scenes. \"With [having] dwarfism, I was able to go down to the studio just to make sure that things can work for me, even something simple like they've given me lower rails so I can put my outfits on. We get physio support and psychology support, too. She says she and her [yet to be announced] dance partner will be learning together. \"He's never danced with anyone with dwarfism before. And I've never danced before in my life. We're just\u2026 going to adapt. Like if I have to hold him differently, I'll hold him differently\u2026 but I think if I can do it\u2026 people watching from home can realise they can adapt. Dancing is for all.\". The actor was picked out by the judge during an interview on BBC's The One Show last month, with Craig saying of Will: \"I think he's got a real charm about him and I think he'll be able to bring that on to the dance floor.\". Will jokingly references a famous Tina Turner track: \"I was Craig's private dancer for many years, his dancer for money.\". Ahead of being \"Strictly-fied\", Will tells us the most outrageous outfit he's worn (so far) was one for \"a Mamma Mia revamp on ITV... wearing knee-high platform boots. I watched it after and thought: 'That might have been a mistake!'\". The former Arsenal and England captain is under no illusions on the challenge ahead. \"This is not the football pitch. It's a bit different! I'm on my toes quite a bit. The only thing in common is the trailing leg!\". Several ex-pro footballers have taken part in the show previously, including Peter Schmeichel, Peter Shilton and Robbie Savage. \"They all said don't do it, don't be stupid,\" Tony jests. \"I'm at a stage in my life when I can do anything. . I'm free of addiction. , I've not taken drink or drugs for 26 years and I can just go into it, nuts and bolts.\". CBBC star and singer Molly first found fame on ITV's Britain's Got Talent as a child, reaching the finals 10 years ago. But she's slightly more anxious this time around. \"When I was 11, I don't think I knew what I was getting into,\" she says. \"Whereas now I kind of do. I'm definitely a little bit more nervous than I was when I was little. . \"Because I've had Simon [Cowell as a judge], am I scared of Craig? I know Simon had a little soft side and he was really a big teddy bear at the end. So hopefully Craig's the same!\". The singer and presenter is friends with AJ Odudu, who took part in last year's Strictly. \"She just said: 'Surrender to the sequins! This is going to be so hard but the best thing you're ever going to do.'. \"I'd love to dance to my own music, that would be amazing. My mum's from Ghana and I grew up on highlife music and Afrobeats. It would be really fun to do something like that.\". Fleur is feeling the strain already - she was two hours late to her radio breakfast show after the first day of filming. \"I'm sorry I let you down but I was just shimmying and shaking to the wee hours and it knocked me out!\" she told her listeners on Hits Radio. You'll get used to it, Fleur. \"I was nervous about the lifts because although I go to the gym and\u2026 I feel quite physically strong, this is completely different,\" he says. \"Doing that [a lift] after a whole minute running around the dance floor is mad!\". He says he's excited about people getting to know him. . \"It gives you an opportunity to just present who we actually are. And I feel like if I was the kid watching a show like Strictly with my family and [could] say: 'Wait, I look like them or I sound like him or I've got dreadlocks or whatever,' that's motivation. The representation is there.\". James Bye, who plays Martin Fowler in EastEnders, says he doesn't feel any pressure after his co-star Rose Ayling-Ellis won Strictly last year. . \"I'm not a very competitive person. So as long as I beat Rose, I'm not bothered!\" he laughs. James is one of a long line of EastEnders actors to take part so who else would he like to see give it a go?. \"I would love Lacey (Turner) to do it. I don't know if she would, but I think she would be fantastic. Or Steve McFadden. I think Phil Mitchell in sequins would be the ultimate!\". \"I think the nice thing for me about this is\u2026 normally I'm on my own, it's just the nature of my work,\" the former Blue Peter presenter says. \"I went to Antarctica [for Sport Relief], they intentionally got a non-English speaking sound man because they wanted me to be on my own, like a real explorer. Whereas this, it's nice to be in and around people, to be sharing something in a team. That's why I talk a lot!\". Her family are gearing up to watch Helen strut her stuff later this month. . \"My mum's excited, my dad's excited, even my brother, and I love him as I say this, he's the most serious man in the world - and he's excited!\". The Loose Women anchor has been practising her Charleston swivel. \"Why did I do this? It took me six weeks [to be able to do it]! I'm going to sign up for 2023!\" she jokes. Don't worry though, Kaye's had some great advice from the Loose Women who have already taken part in the show. \"They basically said to me: 'Don't screw it up!'\".", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-62818807", "related_stories": ["Strictly Come Dancing: The line-up in full", "Bruno Tonioli sad to leave Strictly Come Dancing"], "related_topics": ["Dance", "Strictly Come Dancing"]},

And while Apple TV's new movie, which stars Zac Efron and Russell Crowe, may not be traditional Oscars bait, it's worth looking beyond its somewhat trivial title. Director Peter Farrelly's previous film, Green Book, won best picture in 2019, which means there is significant interest in the story he's chosen for his latest project. . The Greatest Beer Run Ever follows the true story of Chickie Donohue, a US marine who, in 1968, travelled across the world to deliver a crate of beer to his mates who were fighting in the Vietnam War. At that time, morale among the soldiers was low, so the New Yorker set out on a four-month journey with a (presumably very heavy) bag of beer on his back, to lift their spirits. Delivering beer to enlisted men from your neighbourhood is all fun and games, until Donohue actually gets there and is confronted with the quite brutal realities of war. (One character tells him the expedition is \"the dumbest thing I ever heard\".) Donohue himself had served four years in the Marines, but hadn't experienced combat. \"Tonally, it starts light,\" Farrelly told journalists earlier this month after the film's premiere in Toronto. \"The silliness of this guy trying to bring a beer to his friends in Vietnam is just nuts, and you see him smiling, then when he gets to Vietnam the reality hits and the tone changes, but it's natural. . \"It didn't take a lot of work on my part, it took a lot of work on [Efron's] part because he had to become a different guy along the way.\" . Efron says: \"I couldn't believe it was a true story, it just sounded like a very silly idea and young and stupid. But the journey that starts there is very magical and profound. So it's ended up one of the coolest gestures you can possibly make.\". The tone of the film feels a little muddled, but that's partly because the tone of the original expedition must have been the same. The backdrop of bombs, deaths and blood jar somewhat with what Donohue is trying to do. But, Efron argues: \"I love the human element you're able to find in some of the darkest moments, and there's always something that is unique or comes out of tension that can make you laugh.\". \"What interested me,\" Farrelly adds, \"was it was a guy going into a war zone, during an act of war, to bring beer to his friends. I love that person, the stupidity of it, the hubris, and the amount of heart it takes for him to want to do that, and actually pull it off.\". Early reviews of the film have been mixed. . IndieWire's Kate Erbland said.  Beer Run \"is not a gritty war picture; it's glossy and entertaining and often fun. Farrelly has got a story that requires both blind faith and nutty optimism\". But, she acknowledged: \"For some viewers, the distance between straight-up entertainment and the Tet Offensive may be a bridge too far.\". Other critics were much less enthusiastic. . The Hollywood Reporter's Michael Rechtshaffen.  called it \"a meandering, disjointed production that struggles throughout to find a satisfying tone\", while . The Guardian's Charles Bramesco.  accused it of \"regurgitating every Vietnam clich\u00e9 with the laziest possible visual diction\". But with one best picture win under its belt thanks to . the 2021 surprise hit Coda,.  Apple TV+ will be hoping The Greatest Beer Run Ever is firmly on Academy voters' radar. For Farrelly, it marks the latest in a long line of road trip movies - something which he says is sheer coincidence. \"If you look at all my movies, they're almost all road trips,\" he notes. \"Dumb and Dumber, Kingpin, There's Something About Mary, Three Stooges, Green Book, they're all road trips, and I don't know why that is. . \"I lived in the same house for my entire life growing up, we never moved, never went anywhere.\" (\"You're making up for it now!\" Efron chips in). \"Maybe that's part of it, I love road movies, but consciously I don't really think about them.\". The film is adapted from the book Donohue wrote about his adventure, published in 2020, but the story first came across Farrelly's desk thanks to . a 12-minute YouTube doc.  about the expedition, released five years earlier. \"Most of all, [Donohue] is motivated by this pure sense of love for his friends,\" Efron says. . \"But he doesn't have all the answers. He's brave enough to just kind of throw himself out there and follow through with a pretty crazy idea that he had while he was drunk.\". Farrelly concludes: \"I think there's a lesson in this movie - Vietnam was a bad war, and we didn't know it at first. When I say we, Americans thought it was World War Two, but it wasn't, it was a completely different thing. . \"It took years for the truth to come out, and finally by the 1970s Americans started seeing the reality of what that war was, and it was a disaster, it was bad, it didn't help anybody. Many Americans died and many more Vietnamese people died, and it was unnecessary.\".

Some will know he is the youngest ever (and first black American male) EGOT winner, earning an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony Award. But Legend is probably best-known for his ballads... and one ballad in particular. . All Of Me. , a swoonsome tribute to his wife, the model and chef Chrissy Teigen, has sold 3.6 million copies in the UK. On Spotify, and is approaching its 2 billionth play. Legend knows the success has pigeon-holed him. \"For a casual listener, they probably think I'm just a balladeer,\" he says. \"My albums have always had a hip-hop influence - but the ballads are the ones that have grabbed people by their hearts. \"When I was a management consultant, we used to call it a 'competitive advantage'. There's certain things a company does that they're better at than anybody else. And I think ballads are my competitive advantage.\". Legend had always been an over-achiever. . Born John Roger Stephens in Ohio, he began playing piano at the age of four, and was a spelling bee champion by 10. At school, he was so academically gifted that he skipped two grades, and left home at 16 to study English at the University of Pennsylvania. There, he became president of the university a-capella group, and was tapped by Lauryn Hill to play on her hit single Everything Is Everything. He assumed he was on the path to stardom, but he was wrong... at least for a couple of years. \"There was a lot of rejection.\" he says, \"but if I'd got a record deal at 18, I would have screwed it up\". \"I didn't know what went into being a successful solo artist. I just thought, 'Oh, I can sing and I'm writing some decent songs,' but there's more to it than that. . \"I'm a coach on The Voice now and that's something I'm always thinking about when I'm advising the artists. They're all really good singers - some of them are much better singers than I am - but the only way for them to make it is to have a point of view that's interesting and distinct and personal. . \"Music is not just a virtuosity competition.\". Those early rejections explain how Legend spent three years as a management consultant, first in Boston, then in New York. . \"It's a demanding job, they expect you to work a decent number of hours,\" he recalls, \"but I was living a double life, writing at night, gigging at night. . \"People always ask me if I get tired now and I'm like, 'I get way more rest than I used to!'\". It was in New York that an old roommate first introduced him to Kanye West, then an up-and-coming artist himself. They immediately hit it off: West employed Legend to sing hooks on his demos, In return, he gave the musician beats for his songs. One of their collaborators, the poet J Ivy, noted that John's smooth, elastic vocals sounded \"like one of the legends\" - and West immediately rechristened his partner John Legend. At first, he was hesitant to adopt the name. \"I was like, 'Damn, what if I flop?' . \"And then my response to myself was, 'No, you're not going to flop. Bet on yourself. Go for it.'. \"I call it audacity. Kanye certainly had it, and has it. I think every successful artist has to have some audacity - to believe that what you have to offer to the world is unique and special, and deserves to be heard.\". West's first album, The College Dropout, arrived in 2004, with Legend featuring on seven tracks. By the end of the year Legend's own debut, Get Lifted, came out on West's GOOD Music label. \"The timing was exactly right,\" he reflects. \"The fact it happened after the College Dropout set me up perfectly.\". He's never looked back. He won the best new artist Grammy in 2006, scored his first platinum single with the 2008 shoe-shuffler . Green Light. , and in 2010 recorded a searing covers album full of still-relevant protest songs, called Wake Up. He met Teigen . on a video set.  and proposed at Christmas 2011 during a trip to the Maldives (the surprise was nearly ruined when airport security demanded to search his bag). . When he first played her All Of Me, she burst into tears... and his music still has the power to move her today. His new album, simply titled Legend, delicately dedicates two songs to Teigen and the baby she lost in 2020 as the result of a pregnancy complication. The couple had already named the unborn child Jack when it became apparent he would not survive. Teigen's life was also in danger. Diagnosed with partial placental abruption - where the placenta comes away from the inner wall of the womb - she was continually losing blood despite \"bags and bags of transfusions\". Eventually, the couple made the \". difficult and heartbreaking. \" decision to end the pregnancy. . \"That pain is never going to completely go away,\" Legend says. \"You're never exactly the same after you lose someone.\". Part of the healing process was a song called Stardust, in which Legend lifts up his wife, celebrating her strength and spirit despite their devastating loss. \"That was one of the earliest songs I wrote for the album, in the aftermath of losing our pregnancy, and it was really meaningful for Chrissy - because it was therapeutic after going through what we went through,\" he says. Another song, Pieces, is a raw but graceful piano ballad about navigating unimaginable grief. . \". The only thing you can do is pick up the pieces,\" . sings Legend. \". Let your broken heart learn to live in pieces. \". \"That whole section of the [album] is really about healing,\" he says. \"It's about figuring out a way to survive through your grief and remembering what you mean to the people that love you, and who you love.\". Legend says he and Teigen found their way through the darkness by focusing on their first two children, Luna and Miles. \"To have two little ones that we could dote on and nurture and enjoy... They bring us so much joy. . \"We just were able to hold each other through what was a very tough time.\". Teigen recently announced that she was pregnant again, after . \"one billion shots\".  of IVF - but Legend says the excitement is tempered by their previous experience. \"There's always this sense of cautious optimism, because you know what it's like to lose one,\" he says. \"And I think that's kind of the message of Pieces: You'll never forget that pain, but you'll find ways to keep going.\". Stardust and Pieces are just two of 24 tracks on Legend's epic eighth album. . Arranged over two discs, it's frontloaded with slinky dance tracks like Dope and All She Wanna Do Is Dance - on Strictly Come Dancing's launch show this week. Splish Splash is another ode to Teigen that, to put it politely, celebrates their marital relations with a cunning linguistic approach. What, I wonder, will their kids think?. \"You know, I make my music for grown-ups,\" he laughs. \"But at some point, they'll figure out what it means and they'll probably be embarrassed by it.\". The second half of Legend settles into a more comfortable neo-soul groove, full of songs about the healing power of love. Wonder Woman is an sparkling standout; as is . Good. , a duet with Ledisi, whose jazzy harmonies put some spice in Legend's step. \"Yeah, we definitely did that,\" he smiles. \"Sometimes we make the chord rub a little more. There's a little more dissonance, and the notes are crowded up together, instead of being evenly spread out. It feels really cool.\". Reviewers have largely preferred the first disc. . Rolling Stone said.  it was refreshing to see Legend shake off \"his usual supper-club decorum\", while . Pitchfork noted.  that collaborators like Rick Ross and Jazmine Sullivan helped the star \"bring more fun to his music than he has in years\". As J Ivy once observed, Legend's biggest skill is blending vintage and modern sounds - and this album contains traces of everyone from Prince and Marvin Gaye to Nina Simone and Nat King Cole, while the low-slung groove of You riffs on Curtis Mayfield's . Diamond In The Back. . Does he worry about referencing his influences after the notorious Blurred Lines copyright trial - where Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams were . successfully sued.  for copying the \"feel\" of Marvin Gaye's Got To Give It Up?. \"That was a terrible court decision,\" Legend says. \"Terrible for music. . \"It was not based on any real understanding of how songwriting works. Part of the creative process is having those influences and letting them inspire you to create something new. And if writers and producers aren't able to do that, then we're not really able to make music. . \"So I try not to let that creep into my head - but lawyers definitely let it creep in there, labels definitely let it creep in there. And I'm like, 'Leave me alone!'. \"I don't want to re-adjudicate that case... but it was a mess of a decision.\". He pauses. \"My lawyers are gonna be so mad I talked about that.\".

Tommy is hosting a lavish birthday dinner at his country pile for his wife Lizzie with guests including fascist leader Oswald Mosley. The gang leader introduces a performance of Swan Lake featuring dancers from renowned company Rambert, which captivates the majority of the audience but sends his brother and partner in crime Arthur to sleep. Peaky Blinders creator Steven Knight is confident no-one will be dozing off during his latest venture, a real-life dance show called Peaky Blinders: The Redemption of Thomas Shelby, again in collaboration with Rambert, but on a much bigger scale. Having also worked with the London-based company on that TV episode and . 2019's Peaky Blinders festival. , Knight was keen to bring the dance experience to a new audience. \"I'm the least likely person to attend a dance show,\" he says. \"And yet the experience I've had watching rehearsals... is absolutely fantastic. I really want to get that message out there that if you think you don't like dance, come and see the show and you'll find out that you do. Anyone who likes Strictly can love this show.\". Knight explains that he wasn't a dance fan before Rambert got involved with the BBC TV series \"simply because I'd never been\", adding: \"It's like going to your first football match and you go 'oh wow, it's brilliant'.\". Dance critic Lyndsey Winship says it can be difficult to attract new audiences to dance because of preconceptions: \"So many people love to dance, or to watch dance on TV, but would never think of going to see a stage show. So something with a well-known title and story like Peaky Blinders is a good way of tempting them into the theatre. . \"In the popular imagination, dance is still so often associated with ballet and Swan Lake and fairy tales, but the contemporary dance scene is so much more than that, and it's great if people's eyes can be opened to that.\". The production begins as a prequel with the Shelby boys fighting in the trenches during World War One, but then it \"takes us through into a very familiar story, and it's not giving too much away to say it's about Tommy and Grace\", Knight explains. The pair's tragic romance will already be familiar to fans of the TV show. Rambert's artistic director Benoit Swan Pouffer is the creative lead behind the production and is keen to point out that his interpretation is not just focused on the machismo of the leading male characters. \"When the young men went to the war, who ran the world? Who was doing the labour and working? Women,\" he says. \"There's always a sense of that in the show. I wanted to put forward the strength of the woman as well. I have male and female and non-binary dancers.\". Much of the story is told through dance and staging with no dialogue other than some narration courtesy of Benjamin Zephaniah, who plays Jeremiah in the BBC One series. . \"It's a great challenge to try to tell a story without words. But fortunately, Benoit and Rambert are masters at it,\" Knight says. . \"And so what I did was put some things down on paper and then handed it over to Benoit, he's crafted it and changed it and made it what it is now.\". Pouffer adds that Knight \"was surprised that I asked him to write a script, but that was my blueprint. Once I had this it was easier to... create the show because I was anchored in a good way with his vision.\". I'm curious to know how challenging it was to cast such iconic characters that are known to millions, particularly Cillian Murphy's Tommy. \"It's not about the physical aspects\u2026 you really need to understand who those characters are,\" Pouffer tells me. . \"Who is Polly? Who is Jeremiah? Who is Arthur? Rambert is a company made up of individuals who can tell stories naturally and that was even before Peaky Blinders, so it was pretty easy to cast because I have strong personalities in the company. And it was very organic. \"Human beings are complex. Tommy Shelby is a complex man with a lot of layers of sensibility. He is not just a bandit. You understand the reason why he's acting that way, his struggle and his hurt,\" he continues. \"And through what Steven wrote us, it really pushes forward this dilemma that Tommy has in his head and in his life. Through the show, you will have this journey of understanding of what makes a Peaky Blinder and why Tommy Shelby has this redemption.\". Four young dancers from the company landed the lead roles - Seren Williams and Prince Lyons will share the parts of Tommy and Grace with Guillaume Queau and Naya Lovell. Williams says: \"We're not necessarily copying and pasting what you see in the series, we're taking the mindset of the characters\u2026 and translating that into movement, so there's still similarities between them.\". Lyons adds: \"We have a lead who is a white male and I'm clearly not a white male!. \"You are watching a different idea and it's kind of forcing you to view this world in a completely different light, the same way that a white Ariel [from The Little Mermaid] would look completely different to . the new Ariel that's coming out.  It's forcing you to use a bit of your imagination. \"The same way that if you were to read a book, if the author didn't fully describe what these characters look like, depending on who you are and who you grew up around, you make your own opinions based on what you've gone through and the culture around you.\". He adds: \"I just hope that audiences are able to view the beauty of our interpretation.\". Knight has three things he would like the audience to come away with. \"I want them to have had a fantastic evening. I want them to be quite emotional at the end of it. And for them to go away thinking dance is something that they enjoy.\". The show opens in Birmingham later this month. Knight smiles. \"It can't be anywhere else.\". Peaky Blinders: The Redemption of Thomas Shelby premieres at the Birmingham Hippodrome on 27 September followed by a run at Wembley Park ahead of a UK tour next year.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-62966638", "related_stories": ["Peaky Blinders dedicates series launch to McCrory", "Peaky Blinders film to follow final TV series"], "related_topics": ["Dance", "Peaky Blinders", "Birmingham"]},

The former TV executive was appointed to the role in May and in his first major speech since then, he underlined Ofcom's independence from \"personal preference\" and \"political pressure\". He suggested public debate had descended into \"angry battlefields of bitter division\". \"Why does this matter to Ofcom?\". Lord Grade, who has previously held senior positions at the BBC, ITV and Channel 4, made the comments during his keynote speech at the RTS London Convention 2022. \"Here, I want to be very clear: Ofcom does not, and should not, regulate the culture wars,\" he continued. \"Some try to conscript us to their cause. But we're not interested. That is not our job.\". He added: \"Whether we are judging that Piers Morgan's comments about the Duchess of Sussex were justified by freedom of expression, or that Diversity's tribute to the Black Lives Matter movement was, too - we never make decisions based on personal preference, political pressure, fear or favour. \"Instead, we all leave our various opinions at the door. We focus on the legal framework and duties given to us by Parliament, and make careful, balanced decisions based on the evidence.\". Before taking on his new role, Lord Grade criticised the BBC's coverage of Downing Street parties, describing it as \"gleeful and disrespectful\", and spoke in favour of the privatisation of Channel 4. But speaking on Tuesday, the former Conservative peer - who has now moved to the crossbenches - said he would now put his \"personal opinions\" to one side while carrying out his new role. \"Our [Ofcom's] role is to provide research and evidence, to adapt our regulation and to inform Parliament about policy options and their impact,\" he said. He said that long-term questions about Channel 4's ownership, BBC funding and how \"legislation might level the playing field where PSBs [public service broadcasters} compete with US streamers,\" were matters for the government, not Ofcom. The new Culture Secretary Michelle Donelan said last week that she would \"re-examine the business case\" for privatising Channel 4. Ms Donelan's predecessor Nadine Dorries had set out plans to take the broadcaster out of public ownership, as well as suggesting . the next announcement about the BBC licence fee would be the last.  and that it was time to discuss new ways to fund and sell \"great British content\". On Tuesday, Lord Grade asserted his view that public service broadcasters should be protected, noting their impact on the country's creative industries. He also spoke about social media, something . he has previously said he does not use himself. Lord Grade told the audience that Ofcom should not seek \"to regulate the tone of debate on social media\", noting how he cared \"on a personal level\" about \"the need for tolerant debate\". \"That matters to me not just as a citizen and parliamentarian, but also as somebody who has sought to champion our world-class broadcasting sector,\" he said. \"Because broadcasting has a unique ability to provide a fair, accurate and trustworthy platform for calm, considered differences. \"Those views are more necessary than ever for a stable society and a strong democracy.\". BBC director general Tim Davie said last year it was harder than ever for the the corporation to maintain impartiality amid \"culture wars\" and a polarisation of online views.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-63058809", "related_stories": ["Holly and Phil 'not feeling great' after backlash", "Government re-examines case for selling Channel 4", "Lord Michael Grade confirmed as Ofcom chairman", "Lord Michael Grade to be Ofcom chairman", "How much is the BBC licence fee and why is it under threat?", "Harder to be impartial amid culture wars - BBC boss"], "related_topics": ["Ofcom", "Television", "Radio"]},

It focuses on the start of the Covid pandemic, his hospital admission after catching the virus and his son's birth. The Times.  described it as \"a gruelling watch, but a mesmerising one\". The Telegraph.  said Branagh \"fails to get under Boris's skin\" in Michael Winterbottom and Kieron Quirke's series, while . the Guardian.  called This England \"TV at its most triggering\". Writing for the Telegraph, Anita Singh gave the \"dud\" drama just two-stars, saying Branagh's \"bad wig and prosthetics overshadow what could have been a serious drama about the pandemic and lockdown\". \"This is a story of care home deaths, inadequate PPE, relatives forced to say deathbed goodbyes to their loved ones over FaceTime,\" she said. \"The problem is that other dramas have told this story far better - think of Jack Thorne's terrific Help, starring Jodie Comer as a carer. \"Here, the sadness of those scenes is undercut by the action switching back to Whitehall every few minutes, where an actor [Andrew Buchan] is attempting to impersonate [former Health Secretary] Matt Hancock.\". She described the portrayal of Johnson as a \"living, breathing version of Spitting Image\". Carol Midgley, writing in the Times however, opined the show was \"brilliantly realistic\", offering four stars. \"Too brilliantly realistic,\" she added, noting how she had actually had to turn it off after a particularly \"excruciating\" death scene. \"Michael Winterbottom does a masterful job entwining the parallel narratives of Covid approaching like a bullet train and Johnson distracted by his domestic dramas: his divorce, his pregnant girlfriend, Carrie, his grown-up children ignoring his voicemails, and his asking 10 Downing Street staff to 'do the honours' and pick up Dilyn the dog's poo,\" she wrote. \"If This England were a cartoon character it would be Road Runner, such is the break-neck speed at which events are covered, real footage woven into the drama.\". Both journalists appeared to agree though that Johnson's Covid-induced dream sequence featuring his family was a major mis-step. Johnson's wife Carrie Symonds is played on the show by Ophelia Lovibond, while his controversial chief advisor Dominic Cummings is portrayed by Simon Paisley Day. The Guardian's Hollie Richardson said Branagh, seen regularly quoting William Shakespeare, was \"sickeningly accurate as Boris Johnson\". \"It starts in early 2020 when Brexit, floods, a cabinet reshuffle and writing a book on Shakespeare distract Johnson from a 'mysterious Sars-like virus' outbreak in China,\" she wrote. \"This programme might have been made too soon - but perhaps its very intention is to be unsettling.\". In its three-star review, . BBC Culture.  tended to agree, saying Branagh was \"utterly convincing\" as Johnson but that the series contained \"extremely distressing scenes and fails as a drama when those events are still unfolding\". \"It used to be said that journalism provides the first draft of history,\" wrote Neil Armstrong. \"Now, it seems, hard on journalism's heels, comes a high-profile six-part drama.\". For the . Financial Times. , the programme \"pulls off the unusual feat of feeling simultaneously premature and dated\", while turning the \"floundering former prime minister into a tragic theatrical hero\". \"For many viewers, watching a dramatisation of the pandemic while the realities of illness, loss and lockdown remain raw will seem like a pointless or masochistic endeavour,\" wrote Dan Einav, while dishing out three-stars. \"Those who are drawn by the Sky mini-series' focus on the goings-on at Number 10 will find a truncated story.\". He noted how with work on the series having begun so early in the pandemic, it \"culminates not with Partygate (which precipitated Boris Johnson's political collapse) but with Dominic Cummings' ophthalmological adventures to Barnard Castle\".\"While This England may be less than necessary, it does offer more than a run-through of the early Covid timeline,\" he went on. \"Billed as 'a fiction based on real events', it combines an account of the government's reactive, insufficient and often careless handling of the crisis with a strange, intriguing and speculative character study of Johnson.\". The i . offered four-stars, agreeing the show had \"the makings of a persuasive critique of what went right and (more to the point) wrong when Johnsonian Britain collided with a global health crisis\". . But, reviewer Gerard Gilbert added that anyone hoping for a Downing Street version of [Cromwell drama] Wolf Hall or The Crown would be \"disappointed\", due to the \"kaleidoscopic\" drama's \"scattered\" focus, which leaves Johnson as \"an almost peripheral figure\". \"This is probably not far from the truth,\" he wrote. \"Branagh does a great job of impersonating Johnson's gait, mannerisms and mien (although he looks older around the eyes than the ex-PM), without really telling us much that's new about the man. \"But this is a thoughtful drama and hopefully a more incisive portrait will emerge.\". This England will air on Sky Atlantic and streaming service Now on 28 September.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-63058811", "related_stories": ["PM in intensive care as virus symptoms worsen", "Boris Johnson and fiancee announce birth of son", "Cummings challenged over lockdown trip to Durham"], "related_topics": ["Television", "Boris Johnson", "Kenneth Branagh"]},

They joined the star's former bandmates in Foo Fighters and Chevy Metal to play the songs he loved, as fans celebrated his memory. Foos frontman Dave Grohl said the show honoured the fact that \"this many people connected through one person\". Other star guests included Miley Cyrus, Rush, Cars and M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce. Alanis Morissette - for whom Hawkins played drums before he joined Foo Fighters - gave a fierce performance of You Oughta Know; while comedian Dave Chapelle unexpectedly covered Radiohead's Creep. Pink made several appearances during the concert, joining Heart's Nancy Wilson to duet on Barracuda, before tackling Queen's Somebody To Love - a song that Hawkins often covered in concert himself - and teaming up with Foo Fighters to sing The Pretender at the show's finale. British rock band Def Leppard recalled that they had first encountered Hawkins when he was a \"20-year-old kid\" working in a guitar shop in LA. \"About five years later we did Top Of The Pops in England [and] this kid walks into the dressing room. He was playing drums for Alanis Morissette,\" recalled singer Joe Elliot. \"That was Taylor Hawkins, so in memory of. Let's do some proper songs for Taylor.\" . The band played Rock Of Ages before being joined briefly by pop star Miley Cyrus for an expansive version of Photograph. \"It's like a revolving door of rock heroes tonight,\" said Grohl halfway through the concert, which also saw performances from Skid Row's Sebastian Bach, Black Sabbath's Geezer Butler and Metallica's Lars Ulrich. One of the most moving moments came when the surviving members of Nirvana, Grohl and Krist Novoselic, teamed up with fellow grunge musicians Matt Cameron and Kim Thayil of Soundgarden - who lost their lead singer Chris Cornell five years ago. Together, they played haunting versions of The Day I Tried to Live and Black Hole Sun, with vocals from Taylor Momsen of the Pretty Reckless. Rush, who are also mourning the loss of their drummer Neil Peart, played Working Man with assistance from Red Hot Chili Pepper Chad Smith and YYZ with Danny Carey of Tool. And Wolfgang Van Halen delivered flawless renditions of his father's fretwork on covers of pop-metal classics Panama and Hot For Teacher. The concert came less than a month after a previous tribute show at Wembley Stadium in London, which saw Foo Fighters joined by Sir Paul McCartney, Liam Gallagher and Supergrass. As at that concert, Hawkins' children played a key role, with his teenage son Shane stepping behind the drum kit for a blistering rendition of the Foo Fighters' hits My Hero and I'll Stick Around. Hawkins' other children Everleigh and Annabel, also appeared on stage with their mother, Alison, after Queen's Brian May played Love Of My Life - a song that Alison had requested specially. Earlier, the show had opened with Grohl's daughter Violet giving a low-key, moving performance of Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah. Six hours later, Foo Fighters closed the show with Everlong. \"This one's for Taylor,\" Grohl told the audience at LA's Kia Forum. \"We love you.\". Hawkins drummed with Foo Fighters from 1997 until his death in March of this year, aged 50. No cause of death was announced, although a toxicology report showed traces of 10 substances in his body, including opioids, marijuana and anti-depressants. Investigators did not say whether the mix of drugs was a factor. Proceeds from both the London and Los Angeles tribute concerts will go to the charities Music Support and MusiCares. Follow us on .

The rapper was named Diversity Champion for his efforts to \"level the playing field\" through his charities Merky Foundation and Merky Books. \"I encourage everyone in the room today to not just use diversity as a buzzword,\" he said in his speech. \"Whatever position you're in... let that be a driving factor, and not just see it as a quota or a box to tick.\". Addressing a room full of music industry executives, he stressed \"the worth and the value\" of embracing a wide range of voices in the workplace. According to the . latest figures from UK Music. , 22% of people working in the music industry are from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds; while women hold 49.6% of industry roles. However, career progression for these groups remains sluggish, with representation tailing off in higher age and income brackets. . Stormzy's Merky Foundation has pledged \u00a310m over 10 years to organisations and charities \"committed to fighting for racial equality, justice reform and black empowerment within the UK\". It currently supports the Black Heart Foundation, which aims to improve access to education for underprivileged children, and partners with Cambridge University to award \u00a320,000 scholarships to black students. The AIM Awards celebrate achievement in the independent music sector, and Wednesday night's ceremony also saw outstanding contribution awards for The Libertines and Lethal Bizzle - both of whom performed at the after party in London's Roundhouse. Soul singer Cleo Sol won best independent album for her thoughtful, intimate album Mother, which juxtaposes her feelings about becoming a new mother with the turbulent relationship she had with her own family. Indie duo Wet Leg, whose debut album is up for this year's . Mercury Prize. , won best breakthrough; while their fellow Mercury nominees Nova Twins won best track for the defiantly raucous Antagonist. US singer Mitski, who supported Harry Styles on his UK tour this summer, was named best live performer, while pop alchemist Rina Sawayama took home the innovation award. Up-and-coming artist Nia Archives was crowned this year's \"one to watch\", as she spearheads a revival in the jungle scene. And London singer-songwriter Nilufer Yanya won the BBC 6 Music \"difficult second album\" prize for her critically-acclaimed record, Painless. The winners' trophies all carried the symbol for Autistic Pride Day, as part of AIM's own commitment to diversity. \"Neurodiversity is a subject close to AIM's heart with several neurodiverse members in the team, the wider community and our families,\" said CEO Paul Pacifico in his opening speech. . \"Music can and should be a safe and enabling environment for people who think and experience the world differently.\".

She pulls up in a black cab, her hair tied in a knot, and plonks down on a sofa to record a song called What You Gonna Do With That Air?. It's a bright pop anthem that has Twain punching the sky as she reaches the chorus... but it turns out the inspiration was much darker. \"It's about the anxiety of running out of air,\" the singer explains. . \"I had a very bad bout with Covid, with Covid pneumonia, and it was very touch-and-go. I was feeling like, oh my God, I just have to breathe.\". The condition was particularly frightening because Twain had experienced that constriction in her throat before. . At the height of her fame in 2003, she was bitten by a tick and contracted Lyme disease, causing nerve damage to her vocal cords that stopped her singing for almost a decade. She only recovered after open throat surgery, re-emerging in 2012 with a newfound rasp to play the first of two blockbuster Las Vegas residencies. After Covid, Twain came out swinging again. What You Gonna Do With That Air is both a celebration of life and a challenge to herself: what will you do with the extra time you've been given?. \"The Super Bowl would be a great one,\" she smiles, referring to the high-profile half-time show. \"That's a good target. I just need to think about which songs.\". The 57-year-old has always been a survivor. Born in Windsor, Canada, her childhood was tough. She recalls her parents being unable to afford food and \"the humiliation of going to school dirty because we didn't have water\". \"It took a lot of mental management to keep your chin up and function without letting it shut you down.\". There was violence at home, too. In her autobiography, Twain recalled a night when her mother's second husband knocked his wife unconscious then tried to drown her in the toilet. Twain grabbed a chair and smashed it across his back. He punched her in the jaw. She retaliated. At the time, she was 11 years old. \"Thank God for music, because I was literally able to escape my reality,\" she says.  . \"I started to see my guitar as a teddy bear. Even now, if there's a guitar in the room, I just want to sit and hold it. I don't need to do anything with it, it's just kind of like a blankie.\". As her talent grew, Twain's mother pushed her on stage. She would often be pulled out of bed at one in the morning to play local clubs, where licensing laws meant she couldn't sing while alcohol was being served. Although she was making a name for herself, her ambition was not to become a star, but to sing backing vocals for Stevie Wonder. \"I didn't have any desire to be in the front,\" she recalls. \"I always had terrible stage fright.\". When she was 21, fate cruelly intervened. Twain's mother and stepfather died in a car crash and she was forced to take a job singing in a local resort to support her younger siblings. That ultimately led to a recording contract, and she was thrown into the bear pit of the music industry. \"But by the time I made it to Nashville, I was like, OK, this doesn't scare me. I'm not afraid of a few sexist men. I made it through my childhood and the rest was a lot easier.\". She certainly needed resilience. Early headlines asked questions like: \"She's hot, but can she sing?\", while musician Steve Earle notoriously called her \"the highest-paid lapdancer in Nashville\". But Twain had the last laugh. She became one of the first \"crossover\" stars, successfully fusing country melodies to the bombast of stadium rock. The formula was all hers (while other country singers idolised Patsy Cline, she sang Pat Benatar in a teen covers band), but it was realised by her then-husband Robert \"Mutt\" Lange, the producer behind AC/DC's Back In Black and Def Leppard's Hysteria. . Their first album together, 1992's Come On Over, sold more than 40 million copies, thanks to the megaballad You're Still The One and funny, empowering anthems like That Don't Impress Me Much. It's still the world's best-selling album by a female artist, and the ninth best-seller of all time in the US. \"I've been accused of changing the sound of country music forever,\" she says matter-of-factly. \"But I've also been accused of ruining country. I've been accused of a lot of things.\". Despite the criticisms, Twain's songs avoid anger and retribution. When she writes about feminism, on tracks like Man! I Feel Like A Woman!, the lyrics are life-affirming and celebratory. . \"There's no point in being angry. It doesn't get us anywhere,\" she says. \"Every man that I see singing Man! I Feel Like A Woman! is doing it in a good spirit, because that was my intention. \"This is not a man's world and it's not a woman's world. This is our world and we have to share it respectfully. . \"But I will stand up for myself and I will tell you if I feel you've crossed the line.\". Twain was in the middle of a world tour when she caught Lyme disease. In her documentary, she recalls how the symptoms included \"millisecond blackouts\" that occurred once every minute. \"Before I was diagnosed, I was on stage very dizzy. I was afraid I was gonna fall off.\". It wasn't just the end of her career that Twain faced at that moment, but the end of her marriage. Lange was having an affair with her best friend, Marie-Anne Thi\u00e9baud, and they divorced in 2008. (Twain later married Thi\u00e9baud's ex-husband, Frederic, a complicated development that her documentary subtly leaves to one side.). Those feelings all fed into her last album, Now, released in 2017 and written entirely on her own. \". I tried to scream/But silence haunted/Me in my sleep/Oh, and probably always will,. \" she sang on the slow-burning ballad I'm Alright. On her forthcoming album, however, Twain's irrepressible optimism is back. . \"With the pandemic, I just really wanted to cheer myself up,\" she says. \"As we all know, it was a very stifling and crippling emotional and mental exercise that endured for months and months and months. \"So I was like, I just want to be happy! And to me, that was writing happy songs and playing with words again.\". A release date for the album is still to come - but the first single, Waking Up Dreaming, has gone straight onto BBC Radio 2's playlist. . The music arrives as Twain's stock is on the rise, with artists like Taylor Swift, Avril Lavigne and Haim singing her praises as a trailblazer and a feminist icon. . Harry Styles is a fan, too, asking the star to duet with him at the Coachella Festival. \"It's surreal that I have classic music and I'm still alive,\" she laughs. \"I feel like it's happening too soon, almost. \"The funny thing is, I remember seeing all these little kids at my concerts all these years ago, and now they're grown up and they're the Harry Styles and the Taylor Swifts. \"Look at what I've done!\".", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-63046102", "related_stories": ["Shania sorry for saying she'd vote Trump", "Shania Twain on new album - and voice"], "related_topics": ["Music"]},

It had claimed sovereignty over the islands for many years. The country's ruling military junta did not believe that Britain would attempt to regain the islands by force. The ruling military junta was wrong. . Britain, under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, assembled warships, refitted merchant ships and sent a task force 8,000 miles (12,900 km) across the globe to the South Atlantic. Over the next 10 weeks, 649 Argentine military personnel, 255 British military personnel, and three Falkland Islanders were killed. Forty years on, Tamsin McLeod, an islander who grew up in the shadow of the conflict and now lives in London, tells the BBC what her homeland means to her - and how the island families coped with their peaceful lives being thrust into the arena of war. \"Our nickname is 'Kelper' because of all the seaweed and kelp surrounding the islands, so I'm a Kelper or Falklander first and British second, and on the islands we are so, so eternally grateful for what the British did. I probably wouldn't be here today if that task force had not been sent. . \"My parents didn't really talk about it to me much as I grew up. \"It was something that happened, where you have the Liberation Day and the parades and the receptions, and you attend them and everything. And it's very personal. . \"But the older I've become the more my parents have opened up about it. My parents would say in passing, 'oh, yeah, your aunt and uncle were locked in the Goose Green town hall for 30 days'.\" . During the war more than 100 islanders were held at gunpoint and imprisoned in the community hall at Goose Green. They had been summoned to a meeting there by Argentine officials. They were kept at the hall, in appalling conditions, for nearly a month. In just two months of hostilities in the Falklands, 891 men died, 132 aircraft were lost, and 11 ships were sunk. \"It was always there. It's always in the background. It's the legacy of the conflict - especially with the landmines. It was completely normal to be surrounded by bits of land you couldn't go on, fenced off because there were landmines and if you step on one you could die. . \"So going on a walk, it was like, 'oh, yeah, here's wreckage from a helicopter or something from the war'. \"When the invasion happened, my mum was completing her O-levels. Imagine these being interrupted for three months, because you're being occupied and you're being told you have to learn everything in Spanish. . \"All of a sudden, you have to drive on the opposite side of the road, you've got a curfew. . \"My mum really, really vividly remembers Argentine soldiers turning up at her doorstep because my granddad was the local butcher at the time, and they were like, 'you need to kill mutton and feed us'. . \"And my granddad - he was born in England, he vaguely remembers the Second World War, and he did his national service before moving to the islands. And so he's like, 'I'm not putting my family at risk'. So he shipped his whole family out to Horseshoe Bay, which is another farming settlement in the middle of nowhere. . \"And that's my mum's main experience of the war - her dad being genuinely fearful.\" . Margaret Thatcher addressed the House of Commons on 3 April:. \"We are here because for the first time for many years British sovereign territory has been invaded by a foreign power. . \"After several days of rising tension in our relations with Argentina, that country's armed forces attacked the Falklands yesterday and established military control of the islands \u2026 By late afternoon yesterday it became clear that an Argentine invasion had taken place and that the lawful British government of the islands had been usurped. \"There is not a shred of justification and not a scrap of legality to the invasion. The Falkland Islands and their dependencies remain British territory - no aggression and no invasion can alter that simple fact. . \"It is the government's objective to see that the islands are freed from occupation and are returned to British administration at the earliest possible moment.\" . \"My dad is slightly older. He turned 18 in April during the conflict, he and his brother were helping feed and cook for the British soldiers. They gave their car, their motorbike, the jeep. People stayed on their floor. They were trying to do as much as they could. . \"My dad was a young man at that time and there were people his age dying, soldiers dying. \"You couldn't really escape it. But then in a positive way, you appreciate how lucky you are, how privileged you are. To call yourself a Falkland Islander, to be six generations to grow up here, to have a childhood surrounded by penguins and beaches, to have insanely good fresh air.\". \"The way I grew up, it was 'appreciate what you've got, because we could have really not had this'. \"When I came to the UK, people knew nothing about the Falklands, genuinely nothing. Especially people my age. . \"Occasionally some mention penguins - and sometimes you meet a friend's parents in their 40s or 50s and they remember the conflict. \"It's like, 'I remember hearing about it on the radio or seeing it on the television. Wasn't there a war in the 80s? Wasn't Margaret Thatcher involved?'. \"That's all they knew.\". \"I grew up there, it's my home. So it was completely normal. I didn't know anything different until I moved away and then went, 'oh, hang on a second, there's a whole wide world here'. \"There's still such a strong, strong feeling. My parents are still really close with lots of veterans. They're genuinely family friends. \"My godmother lost her son on the Sir Galahad. She came to the Falklands to see where he lost his life. And it's terrible, terrible circumstances. I don't think a mother should ever have to do that. And she stayed with my family and returned to the island several times since that original visit. . \"And because of that relationship, she became a really important part of my life.\". On 8 June, while preparing to unload soldiers from the Welsh Guards in Port Pleasant, RFA Sir Galahad was attacked by the Argentine Air Force, each carrying three Mk 82 500lb (227kg) bombs. . Sir Galahad was hit by two or three bombs, which exploded and started fires. The explosions and subsequent fire caused the deaths of 48 crew and soldiers. \"People should care about the war. People lost their lives. . \"We are very resilient. We fight for what we believe in and we really want to continue to fight to be British. \"The island has moved on from the war. We have made the most of the sacrifices lost. We still remember the past and we appreciate everything that's happened. But we're looking to the future now. \"We do not have a positive relationship with Argentina at all. It's not civil at all. . \"We are not just statistics and geography - we have heritage, we have history, we have lived experiences that are very valuable to us. . \"We're becoming the gateway to Antarctica on that entire side of the world, which is amazing. We're the scientific hub of the South Atlantic. We have more than 60 different nationalities, including a growing population from Zimbabwe due to the de-miners coming and removing the landmines, so we are really cosmopolitan. And we're really proud of that. . \"I probably will go back. It's home. It's where my family are. I love going home and visiting them and seeing friends. It's a lot slower. . \"That soil is my home. So I carry a piece of it with me wherever I go. My necklace has Falklands sand in it and I promise you, it does not come off. Ever. . \"The Falklands are a part of me and I'm a part of them.\".

His longtime manager Jarez Posey told US media the artist was found unresponsive on the bathroom floor of a friend's house in Los Angeles. Coolio started making music in the 1980s, but he cemented his place in hip hop history when he recorded Gangsta's Paradise in 1995. The exact cause of his death on Wednesday has not yet been revealed. However Mr Posey told TMZ, which first reported the news, that paramedics believed he may have had a cardiac arrest. Coolio, whose real name was Artis Leon Ivey Jr, won a Grammy for Gangsta's Paradise, which was part of the soundtrack for the movie Dangerous Minds starring Michelle Pfeiffer. The haunting track continues to be widely listened to and has just passed a billion streams on Spotify, according to his official website. Over a career spanning four decades he recorded eight studio albums and won an American Music Award and three MTV Video Music Awards. His other hits included Fantastic Voyage, Rollin' With My Homies, 1, 2, 3, 4 (Sumpin' New), and Too Hot. He was active right up until his death - Coolio was in the middle of a tour with other 90s stars including Vanilla Ice and Young MC, and they performed in Texas just a few days ago. \"I'm freaking out I just heard my good friend Coolio passed away,\" Vanilla Ice wrote on Twitter. Snoop Dogg referenced Coolio's world-famous track in his own tribute, writing: \"Gangstas paradise. R I P.\". He also shared a picture of the two posing on the set of the music video for Gangsta Walk, a track they collaborated on in 2006. \"This is sad news. I witness first hand this man's grind to the top of the industry,\" fellow rapper and actor Ice Cube said. MC Hammer described Coolio as \"one of the nicest dudes I've known\". \"Good people. RIP Coolio,\" he wrote, sharing a black and white picture of the rapper, and later posting a second picture of the pair together, along with Tupac and Snoop Dogg.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-63070138", "related_stories": ["Coolio raps and cooks for students", "Coolio on Trump: 'I may move to Europe'", "Rapper Coolio charged with gun possession"], "related_topics": ["Hip-hop"]},

Seven-year-old Joel Verala uses a wheelchair and is fed by a tube due to quadriplegic cerebral palsy. The house has three bedrooms but the family have been told the adaptations he needs could take a year. . Croydon Council said it had always informed the family the work would take \"some months to complete\". . Joel's mum, Souskay Verala, describes her son as a \"happy boy\" on the . BBC Access All podcast. . \"He likes stories read to him, he loves his siblings playing around him, as well as walks outside,\" she says. The family - Souskay, her husband and three children - were excited to be offered the three-bedroom council property in March having lived in a small flat for the previous six years. But, though the new house was described as \"suitable\" for their needs, they maintain it needs adapting before Joel can live there. That includes a lift between floors, widened doors to enable his wheelchair to move through rooms, ramps into the property and hoists. The planning application for the work is yet to be approved and the Veralas have been told it could take at least another 12 months for the work to be completed. . The council said the family could move in as Joel could stay on the ground floor. It said: \"We worked closely with this family, their doctors, and our children's social care and housing teams to find them the right home. We continue to work with them so they can make full use of their new home and are committed to progressing necessary works.\" . In the latest . Access All podcast. , Nikki Fox discusses Joel's access needs and the family's difficult housing situation with mum Souskay Verala. Paralympic skier Millie Knight talks about her new sporting venture - making the England team in karate. She explains how she tackles both sports with 5% vision. . And Nikki goes to the blue badge queue where disabled people are queuing to see the Queen lying in state. . Souskay says the family felt they had no choice but to accept the new bigger house and move out of their original small home. \"We didn't want to go there, but we have been waiting for so long [for a house],\" she says. . But despite already paying rent and council tax on the property given to them, the family felt they could not move in while it remained inaccessible to their son and would prevent him from thriving.  . Instead, the family of five moved in to the one-bedroom flat where Souskay's mother lives. . As well as having six people in the small property, space is further compromised by Joel's sizeable medical equipment, including wheelchair and specialist bed. \"It's very difficult for me to see my mum like that. She has a bad back and knees and she's sleeping on the sofa,\" Souskay says. \"It's very stressful and I'm very anxious.\". Christina McHale, from housing association Habinteg which specialises in accessible and adaptable properties for disabled people, says living in an accessible property is crucial to someone's quality of life and development. \"Frequently we hear about the transformational effect that it has on people's health and wellbeing at whatever age they are, and the independence and dignity which comes from having a home that meets their needs.\". Souskay is also worried about the impact their housing situation is having on her two other, younger, children. She had moved them to a school closer to the new property but, as they don't yet live there, it presently means a journey of more than 30 minutes each way. And while her husband works full-time, Souskay is Joel's main carer. . Christina says when it comes to children's access requirements, not enough thought is always given to the fact children grow and their needs change rapidly. . Souskay is not alone in facing such predicaments. While Croydon Council is footing the bill for Joel's adaptations, lots of disabled people use a Disabled Facilities Grant (DFG) to fund necessary enabling changes. Grants of up to \u00a330,000 can be awarded in England. . Legally, the work should be completed within 12 months, but for many the process takes far longer. . In 2020, national disability charity Leonard Cheshire found 67% of councils failed to complete the work within a year while 23% took longer than two years. . And in 2018, the Equality and Human Rights Commission found that the average waiting time for an accessible property was 25 months. . Habinteg has been working with Homefinder UK, a non-profit organisation focused on matching social housing with the right people to try and improve the current situation. . They have recently developed the Accessible Now register which Homefinder's CEO, Ninesh Muthiah, describes as a way \"to improve access to either fully wheelchair accessible social housing or partially adapted housing\". . It uses occupational therapists to assess the properties before they are advertised and matched with people who need the adaptations available, although it can mean relocating out of area which is not always welcome, especially if you have a well established support network. But Ninesh says, nationally, there are currently big \"barriers\" to accessing adequate social housing. \"Supply is the biggest challenge,\" he says. \"There's been a lot of issues post-Covid and post-Brexit because organisations can't do repairs 'as quickly as possible' and they can't get materials or labour.\" . But changes are on the horizon. . Earlier this year the government announced that all newly built properties must meet the \"accessible and adaptable\" criteria, sometimes known as the Lifetime Home Standard. . This includes building properties with wider doorframes for wheelchairs to get through, strong bathroom walls for rails to be fitted as residents age and in larger properties the ability to convert the downstairs toilet into a wet room. . But for Souskay the changes have come too late and the situation is having a huge impact on her entire family. \"I love my mum. But we need our space. I want to feel that I have a family and I have a place on my own, and I enjoy being there.\". You can listen to the podcast and find information and support on the .

It was during dinner that Moss Hills began to realise just how severe the storm was. The ship's waiters, normally completely adept at carrying drinks and food without spilling anything, were struggling. Moss, a guitarist from Zimbabwe working on board the cruise liner alongside his wife Tracy, a bass player, had never seen the waiters dropping trays before.   . Earlier that day, gale-force winds and heavy rains had delayed sailing for the final leg of the cruise towards Durban several times. But with no sign of conditions improving, the captain eventually decided to lift anchor and the Oceanos, with 581 guests and crew on board, sailed off into 40-knot winds and 9m-high (30ft) waves. . Moss and Tracy, both in their 30s, would usually host parties up on the pool deck as the ship sailed away from port. But that day the party had been moved indoors, and Moss braced his body while he played his guitar, trying to keep his balance as the ship pitched and rolled. \"The storm just got worse and worse,\" Moss says. . At dinner, Tracy - who her husband describes as unflappable - decided to go to their cabin to organise an emergency bag, just in case. \"Off she went,\" Moss says, \"and suddenly - boom - all the lights went out.\" . When none of the ship's officers appeared to issue instructions, Moss, who was not easily frightened, began to feel uneasy. \"You're on a ship in the middle of the ocean, in the dark of night, in a terrible storm,\" he says, \"I felt this tightening in my stomach.\". When small, dim emergency lights came on, Moss went up to the lounge to check on the musical instruments on stage. Microphone and cymbal stands were strewn about. Then he suddenly realised he couldn't hear the constant, throbbing, background noise of the engines. The ship had lost power and was slowing down. . Soon the 153m (502ft) Oceanos was drifting sideways onto the crashing waves. The ship, says Moss, was getting hammered. Anxious guests began pouring into the lounge. Pot plants, ashtrays, and chairs were sliding around, and people had to move from their seats to sit on the floor as the ship lurched wildly from one side to the other, port to starboard. About an hour passed, and the mood in the lounge grew tense. Moss grabbed an acoustic guitar and began singing with some of the other entertainers to try to keep people calm. But as time stretched on, Moss noticed that the ship was heeling - no longer coming back to a level position when it was being thrown about in the storm. . \"Something bad is happening,\" Moss said to Tracy, \"I'm going to try and find out what's going on.\". Hear Moss tell his story in a new series of . Life Changing.  on 6 April 2022 at 0900 on BBC Radio 4 - or listen to the . podcast. . . More from Life Changing:. Hanging on to the handrails, Moss and another entertainer, Julian, a magician from Yorkshire, made their way through the darkness below deck. They could hear excited voices speaking many different languages. Officers were running around, some were carrying bags, some had life jackets on, and some were wet. . \"Everyone was pretty wild-eyed and panicked-looking,\" Moss says. \"We were trying to ask, 'What's happening?' but it was like we didn't exist.\". Julian and Moss continued down to the engine room - the lowest part of the ship. \"We were way below the waterline, in the dark, on our own, and there was no-one there,\" Moss says. \"That would never, ever happen, even when you're docked.\". The thick, metal doors which acted as a safety barrier by preventing water moving from one compartment of a ship to another in the event of flooding, were tightly closed. \"But it sounded like there was a large body of water sloshing about behind those watertight doors,\" Moss says. The Oceanos was sinking. . Back up in the lounge, there had still not been any announcements about what was going on. Moss found the cruise director who said the captain had told her they were going to have to abandon the ship. . \"Then we found out that one lifeboat had already gone with a lot of the crew and senior officers on it,\" he says. Moss and the others had no idea how to evacuate a cruise ship, nor how to launch the lifeboats which hung high above the deck along each of the ship's sides, but there was nobody more qualified around to do it. One by one, they began lowering the starboard side lifeboats down to the deck. They didn't know how to keep them steady as people got on, so Moss improvised by standing with one leg on the deck of the ship and the other on a lifeboat. . But each time the ship rolled to starboard, Moss would have to jump back onto the Oceanos before the lifeboat swung away, opening up a gap of a couple of metres, and then swung back, smashing with such force against the ship's hull that bits of it came splintering off. Each heaving lifeboat, now with as many as 90 people in it, many screaming in fear, would then be lowered down to the sea on cables. But Moss had no idea how to start the engines or even where the keys were. \"We'd let them go, off into the night, and they would just drift away into the pounding waves,\" he says. \"The people in the lifeboats had a torturous time - they were getting deluged in spray, it was cold and completely dark, but we just had to carry on until all of the starboard side lifeboats were launched.\". By now the Oceanos was taking in more and more water and heeling markedly to its starboard side. Launching the remaining lifeboats on the port side safely was near impossible. Instead of being lowered down to the water once loaded up with people, the lifeboats would cling to the side of the ship until the next big wave rolled in, tipping the ship enough to let them dangle freely. \"And then gravity would suddenly drop the lifeboat three or four metres (13 ft) in one go, almost tipping people out into the open water, it was horrific,\" Moss says. Eventually, he realised it was too dangerous to continue.  . \"In the effort to try and rescue people we were possibly going to kill them,\" Moss says. And time was running out. Unable to launch any more lifeboats, but with hundreds of people still in need of rescue, Moss and others made their way up to the ship's bridge - where they assumed they would find the captain and the remaining senior officers - to ask what to do next. \"We looked inside, but there was no one there,\" Moss says. \"That's when we realised - it's just us.\". Orangey-red lights blinked in the darkness, but Moss had no idea what most of the equipment was for, never mind how it worked. They took turns trying to use the radio to send an SOS.  . \"I was calling, 'Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!' and just waiting for somebody to answer,\" Moss says. A big, deep, rich voice eventually replied. \"Yes, what is your Mayday?\". Relieved, Moss explained that he was on the cruise ship Oceanos and that it was sinking. \"OK. How long have you got left to float?\". \"I don't know - we've got the starboard railings in the water, we're rolling around, we've taken on a huge amount of water,\" Moss said. \"We still have at least 200 people on board.\". \"OK. What is your position?\". \"We're probably about halfway between the port of East London and Durban.\". \"No, no, no, what are your coordinates?\". Moss had no idea what their coordinates were. \"What rank are you?\". \"Well, I'm not a rank - I'm a guitarist.\". A moment's silence. \"What are you doing on the bridge?\". \"Well, there's nobody else here.\". \"Who's on the bridge with you?\". \"So I said, 'It's me, my wife - the bass player, we've got a magician here\u2026'\". Moss was put in contact with two small ships that were close to the Oceanos. They told Moss to find the captain and get him onto the bridge. But Moss had no idea where he was. \"I knew he wouldn't be down below because we were sinking,\" he says. \"I was making regular checks to see where the water level was, and one deck below us was flooded.\". Eventually, Moss found the captain, right at the back of the ship, smoking in the darkness. Moss explained that they needed his help - urgently. \"He was just looking at me, wide-eyed and vacant, saying, 'It's not necessary, it's not necessary,'\" Moss says. \"I think he was in deep, deep shock.\". The two ships close to the Oceanos had only one lifeboat each, so there was little they could do to help. They shared the sinking vessel's coordinates with the South African authorities who began to organise an air rescue mission. . As the storm continued to batter the ship, Moss and Tracy sat together in the near darkness, praying that help would arrive before it was too late. . \"I think the ship is going to go down and it's very likely we're going to go down with it,\" Moss said to his wife. He and Tracy had a 15-year-old daughter, Amber, who'd been on board the Oceanos for the holidays and disembarked just days earlier. Amber was now back at boarding school in South Africa. \"She can't lose both parents,\" Moss remembers saying. \"Whatever we do, we've got to make sure at least one of us gets off.\". More than three hours passed before the first rescue helicopter arrived and hovered above the ship. . Two navy divers were winched down to the Oceanos' deck. They said they needed help to get everyone off before the ship sank, and Moss was given a five-minute crash course on how to run a helicopter airlift. \"Remember, the harness needs to be quite tight under people's underarms,\" the navy diver told him. \"Make sure you get it right because otherwise they'll tip upside down and fall out - you'll kill them on the deck. Do two at a time or else we're going to run out of time. OK? Go.\". One navy diver went to organise the helicopter rescue at the rear of the ship and Tracy and Moss were to organise a second at the front. But as the ship sank ever lower beneath the waves, people began jumping off the steeply pitching deck in panic and a rigid inflatable had to be launched into the churning sea to rescue them. . Dangling in mid-air from the helicopter cable, people who Moss was trying to save were being blown against parts of the ship by the strong winds as they were winched into the sky. There was no way of knowing how badly hurt they were and Moss momentarily lost his nerve. But with so many people still on board, he realised he had no choice but to keep going. In total, five helicopters joined the rescue mission, shuttling back and forth, carrying 12 people at a time to safety as dawn broke and the darkness lifted. . Drained and exhausted, Moss and Tracy were among the last to be strapped into harnesses. \"As we were hovering above the ship it really hit me,\" Moss says, \"I could see the Oceanos was in a critical situation. We could see waves breaking over the bow where we had been rescuing people.\". When the helicopter carrying Moss touched down on the grass, cruise passengers ran towards him singing and cheering, and reaching out to hug him. \"I started to choke up and sob,\" Moss says, \"and then I collapsed.\". On 4 August 1991, about 45 minutes after the last person on board had been airlifted to safety, the Oceanos slipped away below the water. Everyone who had been put into lifeboats was rescued by passing ships and remarkably no lives were lost. . Moss and Tracy, who now live in Liverpool, continued working as cruise ship entertainers for many years. Even now, three decades later, Tracy prefers not to talk about the sinking or dwell on how close they all came to losing their lives. . But Moss, who's been asked about the Oceanos many, many times, finds it cathartic to talk about. He looks back on what happened with great relief. \"I'm not invincible,\" Moss says, \"but if I can get through that, I can get through anything.\". There was an inquiry in Greece which found the captain of the Oceanos and four other senior officers negligent in the ship's sinking. All images courtesy of Moss Hills, unless otherwise stated.

The hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice in London will see a judge decide if the complainants are entitled to compensation. Campaigner Lynn Stewart-Taylor says the lack of provision during the pandemic made the deaf community feel \"excluded\" and \"like we're an afterthought.\". The government says they \"established BSL interpretation at the No10 Covid press conferences via the BBC News channel.\". The case is being heard on Friday September 23 - which happens to be International Day of Sign Languages. A judicial review last year found that out of over 173 Covid briefings to the date of the review, two were unlawful because BSL was not provided on screen. . But Ms Stewart-Taylor, who founded the campaign group #WhereIsTheInterpreter at the start of the pandemic, told the.  BBC's Access All podcast.  that the first nine Covid briefings in March 2020 had no BSL interpreter present. Speaking through a BSL interpreter, she said that the deaf community did not initially know how serious the pandemic was - because they just weren't being told, which was \"terrifying\". The remaining ministerial briefings had an on-screen interpreter superimposed on the screen which was available on the BBC News Channel, iPlayer and later on Government social media channels. . But Ms Stewart-Lynn argues that this meant deaf people could only find out what was happening if they used the BBC. . Ms Stewart-Taylor says it should not be up to individual broadcasters like the BBC to provide the service, but for the government to provide a BSL interpreter and in the room next to speakers so that the original live televised stream and all follow up news reports and clips will always have a signer present. . Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland had in-person interpreters at their devolved briefings from the outset, and so circumnavigated the issue. In the latest episode of Access All. , presenter Nikki Fox discusses the on-going BSL court case with campaigners Lynn and Liam. There is a full transcript available. We also hear from actor Leo Long, the star of the new Netflix film, I Used To Be Famous, on being neurodiverse and playing the role of an autistic drummer. Liam O'Dell, a deaf and disabled freelance journalist who has been following the case says: \"There's a real sense from the government that they're just not taking this seriously. . \"Conferences are still happening where interpretation is not being provided there in person. But if it's in person you don't have to worry about it being just on a BBC channel, because it's accessible by default.  . \"A recent example is Liz Truss stood on the steps of Downing Street, making her first speech as Prime Minister and there was no BSL interpreter next to her. . \"So there's a sense the Government still doesn't get it. It's not about the compensation, it's merely a more punitive measure to hit the Government a little bit financially and to say: 'Look, this is what will happen if you keep treating deaf people as second-class citizens.'\". Many deaf people who use BSL as their first language say they cannot rely on subtitles because for them, English is their second language and the average reading age for deaf people is often reported as being around nine years old.  . The issue has been rolling through the courts for some time. In a case from July 2021, a deaf woman won a claim against the government after a judge found a lack of sign language at two televised Covid briefings had \"served to disempower, to frustrate and to marginalise\". Katie Rowley, then 36, from Leeds, started court action after the events went ahead without interpreters on screen. The government denied breaching its legal obligation to make broadcasts accessible to deaf people. But in his ruling, a judge said the lack of provision constituted discrimination. Ms Rowley is one of the 276 deaf people bringing action against the government in this most recent court case. She uses BSL as her first language and is also dyslexic - making English language subtitles doubly difficult to read. \"I am a slow reader - so that means when I was reading the subtitles, I would miss so much information and [it] would just mess up my head. It would be so difficult - it became impossible,\" Ms Rowley previously told the BBC through an interpreter. A government spokesman says: \"We are committed to supporting disabled people and established BSL interpretation at the No10 Covid press conferences via the BBC News channel and iPlayer, available on all TV packages as part of Freeview.\". If the government is successful in today's hearing, the case will be struck out, although claimants will be able to appeal. If the campaigners are successful, the case could end up going to full trial. If the judge rules in their favour, it will then be decided later how much compensation to award. \"We're in 2022, and we expect to be part of that wider community,\" says Ms Stewart-Taylor. \"To be accepted for the language we use, the culture we have, and so [this case] is about recognising us as a part of the wider community.\".

It comes as hundreds of US farm workers pursue a legal case against its manufacturer, alleging it knew the risk and failed to warn them.  . Andy Pollard was once a farm manager who could leap into his tractor cab. But now his limbs are rigid and his body contorts with spasms. He has advanced Parkinson's Disease, and can no longer control his own movements. . He spent decades spraying herbicides on his land and, unaware of any danger, didn't use protective equipment. . \"Paraquat was a really good thing to use - or so we thought,\" his wife Sue says. \"Andy would be driving around the fields and the spray would be going everywhere.\". She had thought it was a coincidence that the only people she knew with Parkinson's were farm workers, then read about the potential connection with the chemical. \"Why hasn't it been regulated and stopped?\" she asks. \"We've got a lot of people in the same situation.\". Paraquat was first manufactured in the UK in the early 1960s and is sold globally - 377 companies have registered it for sale. It is one of the world's most popular and effective herbicides, millions of farmers have used it to kill weeds. But it is also one of the most dangerous and has caused thousands of poisoning deaths. . Its manufacturer Syngenta says claims of a link between Paraquat and Parkinson's are not supported by scientific evidence, stating it has undergone more than 1,200 safety studies. Andy regularly visits a Dorset farm run by charity Countrymen UK, founded by Julie Plumley after her father John was diagnosed with Parkinson's. The 30-acre working farm sells beef and lamb. In the yard, instead of tractors is a fleet of mobility scooters. \"The farmers come here not because they're ill,\" Julie explains, \"but because they want to get on with living.\". Parkinson's Disease is believed to be the world's fastest-growing neurological condition. It affects neurons in a specific area of the brain called the substantia nigra. . It is degenerative, gradually leading to tremors and stiffness in the limbs. Global studies show rural, agricultural areas often have higher rates of the disease. Julie explains her childhood farm was owned by the local council, so her father had to meet certain conditions. \"He had to use chemicals, because if you got too many dock leaves or thistles, they could take money away from you. Paraquat was the pesticide all the farmers used.\". He would carry a backpack filled with the chemical and spend hours hand-spraying the fields. \"He would have his sleeves rolled up, his arms bare, the liquid dripping down.\". John developed the disease in his 40s and always believed there was a connection to the chemicals. His suspicion deepened when his neighbour Ken Barnes was diagnosed around the same time - he was also in his 40s and had also been using Paraquat for years. . Ken now visits Julie's farm. He has a twinkle in his eye, but his clarity of speech has gone. \"It's a horrible disease,\" says his wife Sue. \"It's taken his life away.\". She says its manufacture in the UK and export should be stopped. \"I wouldn't want my son, who's got farming qualifications, ending up like his father.\". Paraquat has not been authorised for use in the EU since a court ruling in 2007. That is still the case in the UK after Brexit but it is still made - under the brand name Gramoxone - at Syngenta's plant in Huddersfield. It is exported to countries such as the US, Japan and Australia, with a fifth of exports going to the developing world. In the US, nearly 900 farmers and field workers have joined forces to sue the manufacturer, claiming not only is there a link between Paraquat and Parkinson's, but that Syngenta has deliberately hidden the health risks from the authorities. . Syngenta rejects the claims made in the remaining multidistrict litigation case, which is due to come to court later this year. The company's most recent financial statement shows that the company has already paid $187.5m into a settlement fund. But it said the company believes that all of these claims are without merit and the payment is simply to keep the claims from going any further. Toxicologist Prof Jon Heylings worked for Syngenta and its predecessor companies for more than 20 years. After retiring, he turned whistleblower, and has given evidence as an expert witness in the US legal action. . He said farmers who used it without protective equipment, damaging their skin, should be worried. \"If they went out the next day and actually used it again, and the next day, you could absorb more Paraquat through the skin, into the blood and then into the brain,\" he says. \"The issue is really does it actually cause Parkinson's when it gets into the brain? That's one of the key issues around the whole exposure. And if this chemical does cause Parkinson's, who is responsible?\" . There is no scientific consensus and many conflicting studies on any possible association between Paraquat and Parkinson's. In the UK, research charity Cure Parkinson's said exposure was \"a well-recognised environmental risk factor\" but Parkinson's UK said studies show \"a small increased risk\" at most. In the US, a 17-year-long study found Paraquat contributed to Parkinson's onset and progression. And research by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences - part of the US Department of Health - found people who used Paraquat developed Parkinson's two-and-a-half times more often than non-users. But the US regulator, the Environmental Protection Agency, says an updated study couldn't replicate those results and no clear link was found. But there are scientists who believe Syngenta is putting profit before product safety and public health. Prof Heylings has a Syngenta regulatory strategy document from 2003 written while Paraquat was still being used by UK farmers. Its author acknowledges a growing number of studies \"citing a correlation between incidence of Parkinson's Disease and herbicide use, including Paraquat\". He explains: \"Syngenta are trying to influence researchers who are working on Paraquat and also influence the direction of the research because the last thing Syngenta wants is a big blow up on Parkinson's. So the strategy was to downplay anything to do with the potential neurotoxicity of Paraquat that could lead to Parkinson's.\" . It said: \"In our view, Jon Heylings is technically not qualified to comment on Paraquat and Parkinson's Disease. He is certainly not aware of Syngenta's research on the issue, which was mostly conducted from 2008 onwards, after he left the company. We spent tens of millions of dollars investigating Paraquat and Parkinson's disease - and this figure doesn't include the monetary value of internal expert time.\". In a statement, Syngenta said it had invested hundreds of millions of dollars over the product lifetime to ensure its safety. \"Paraquat has been the subject of more than 1,200 safety studies submitted to, and reviewed by, regulatory authorities around the world. Recent thorough reviews performed by the most advanced and science-based regulatory authorities including the United States and Australia continue to support the view that Paraquat is safe.\".

The Gasht-e Ershad (Guidance Patrols) are special police units tasked with ensuring the respect of Islamic morals and detaining people who are perceived to be \"improperly\" dressed. Under Iranian law, which is based on the country's interpretation of Sharia, women are obliged to cover their hair with a hijab (headscarf) and wear long, loose-fitting clothing to disguise their figures. Ms Amini allegedly had some hair visible under her headscarf when she was arrested by morality police in Tehran on 13 September. She fell into a coma shortly after collapsing at a detention centre and died three days later in hospital. The force denied reports that officers beat her head with a baton and banged it against one of their vehicles. In a rare interview, one morality police officer spoke anonymously to the BBC about his experience working in the force. \"They told us the reason we are working for the morality police units is to protect women,\" he said. \"Because if they do not dress properly, then men could get provoked and harm them.\". He said they worked in teams of six, comprising four men and two women, and focused on areas with high foot traffic and where crowds gather. . \"It's weird, because if we are just going to guide people why do we need to pick somewhere busy that potentially means we could arrest more people?\". \"It's like we are going out for a hunt.\". The officer added that his commander would tell him off or say he was not working properly if he did not identify enough people violating the dress code, and that he found it particularly difficult when people resisted arrest. \"They expect us to force them inside the van. Do you know how many times I was in tears while doing it?\". \"I want to tell them I am not one of them. Most of us are ordinary soldiers going through our mandatory military service. I feel so bad.\" . The Iranian authorities' fight against \"bad hijab\" - wearing a headscarf or other mandatory clothing incorrectly - began soon after the 1979 Islamic Revolution, a major aim of which was to make women dress modestly. While many women were doing so at the time, miniskirts and uncovered hair were not uncommon sights on the streets of Tehran before the pro-Western Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was overthrown. His wife Farah, who often wore Western clothing, was held up as an example of a modern woman. Within months of the founding of the Islamic Republic, the laws protecting women's rights that had been established under the Shah began to be repealed. \"It didn't happen overnight, it was a step-by-step process,\" said Mehrangiz Kar, 78, a human rights lawyer and activist who helped organise the first anti-hijab protest. \"Right after the revolution there were men and women on the streets offering out free headscarves to women wrapped in gift paper.\". On 7 March 1979, the leader of the revolution, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, decreed that hijabs would be mandatory for all women in their workplaces and that he considered uncovered women to be \"naked\". \"That speech was received by many revolutionaries as an order to force the hijab on women's heads,\" said Mrs Kar, who is now based in Washington DC. \"Many thought this was going to happen overnight, so women started resisting.\". They responded immediately. More than 100,000 people, mostly women, gathered in the streets of Tehran the following day - International Women's Day - to protest. Despite Ayatollah's Khomeini's decree, it took some time for authorities to decide what was considered \"proper\" clothing for women. \"There were no clear instructions, so [they] came up with posters and banners showing models, which were hung on office walls. They said women should follow these instructions [about wearing a hijab] or they cannot enter,\" explained Mrs Kar. By 1981, women and girls were legally required to wear modest \"Islamic\" clothing. In practice this meant wearing a chador - a full-body cloak, often accompanied by a smaller headscarf underneath - or a headscarf and a manteau (overcoat) covering their arms. \"But the fight against the mandatory hijab continued on individual levels. We were creative in wearing the headscarf or not covering our hair properly,\" Mrs Kar said. \"Every single time they were stopping us, we were fighting.\". In 1983, parliament decided that women who did not cover their hair in public could be punished with 74 lashes. More recently, it added the punishment of up to 60 days in prison. Authorities have nevertheless struggled to enforce the laws since then, and women of all ages are frequently seen pushing the boundaries in public by wearing tight-fitting, thigh-length coats and brightly coloured headscarves pushed back to expose plenty of hair. The extent to which these rules have been enforced and the severity of punishments handed down have varied over the years according to which president has been in power. The ultra-conservative then-mayor of Tehran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, sought to appear more progressive on the issue when he was campaigning for the presidency in 2004. \"People have different tastes, and we have to serve them all,\" he said in a television interview. But soon after his election victory the following year, the Gasht-e Ershad were formally established. Until then, the dress codes had been policed informally by other law enforcement and paramilitary units. The morality police are often criticised by the public for their heavy-handed approach, and women are frequently detained and only released when a relative appears to provide assurances they will adhere to the rules in the future. \"I was arrested with my daughter when we were stopped because of our lipstick,\" one woman from the central city of Isfahan told the BBC. \"They took us to the police station and asked my husband to come and sign a piece of paper that he would not let us out without a hijab.\". Another woman, from Tehran, told the BBC that a female officer said her boots could be \"too erotic\" for men and detained her. \"I called my husband and asked him to bring me a pair of shoes,\" she said. . \"I then signed a paper admitting I was wearing inappropriate clothing and I now have a criminal record.\". Other reports of experiences with the morality police, which have been shared with the BBC, include beatings and more cruel and unusual punishments. One woman said the police threatened to put cockroaches on her body during one of her arrests. President Ebrahim Raisi, a hard-line cleric who was elected last year, signed an order on 15 August to enforce a new list of restrictions. They included the introduction of surveillance cameras to monitor and fine unveiled women or refer them for \"counselling\", and a mandatory prison sentence for any Iranian who questioned or posted content against the hijab rules online. The restrictions led to an increase in arrests but also sparked a surge in women posting photos and videos of themselves without headscarves on social media - something that has only intensified in the days following Ms Amini's death. Masih Alinejad, a journalist and activist now based in the US, says the protests which have erupted since the death of Ms Amini feel deeply personal. Over the years, she has run several viral campaigns against the hijab laws, including #mystealthyprotest and many, including the government, see her as an instrumental force behind the current unrest. Women began removing their headscarves and waving them in the air at Ms Amini's funeral in western city of Saqez on Saturday. In the days that followed, they have taken to the streets across the country and some have been filmed setting fire to their hijabs to cheers from male protesters. \"When they did this it reminded me of the time people started taking the Berlin wall down, it's that moment,\" Ms Alinejad said. \"What makes me very emotional and hopeful is that this is the first time these girls are not alone. Now men are standing with women together.\".", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-62984076", "related_stories": ["Women burn headscarves at Iran anti-hijab protests", "Death of hijab arrest woman 'unfortunate' - Iran", "Iran headscarf protest at arrested woman's funeral", "Fury as woman dies after Iran morality police arrest", "Iran's headscarf video sparks mixed reaction", "Iranian women threw off the hijab - then what?"], "related_topics": ["Iran", "Women's rights", "Islamic veils", "2022 Iran protests"]},

Some likened the furious response by young haredi Jews - for whom talk of sex is taboo and reaching out to police is often not an option - to the #MeToo movement. . Shayli Tevel weeps as he prays, calling out to God: \"Father, I've no energy left to absorb all this.\". The former ultra-Orthodox Jew is wearing a white prayer shawl and tefillin - long leather straps with small boxes attached, containing scrolls with verses from the Torah.  . After a decade of silence, Shayli, now in his early 30s, has recently broken strict religious conventions and spoken publicly about being groomed and sexually abused between the ages of 12 and 19, by a leading ultra-Orthodox - or haredi - figure. . The man Shayli accuses of abusing him is Yehuda Meshi Zahav, famous in Israel as a social activist and the founder of an emergency rescue service. . \"Everyone gave him respect and I wanted to be around him,\" Shayli says. One of 13 children, Shayli often craved attention and felt flattered to be singled out by Meshi Zahav. . Then, one day, Meshi Zahav offered him a free T-shirt. \"When he put [it] on, he put his hand inside my pants.\". There is no sex education at Jewish seminaries called yeshivas - like the ones where Shayli received all his schooling - and he found it hard to articulate the abuse to others. . He thought about harming himself. \"I didn't want life anymore,\" he says. In his early 20s, Shayli did go to the police, but their first investigation of Meshi Zahav was soon closed. \"Everywhere I mentioned his name, the door was shut,\" he says. But that changed in 2021, just after it was announced that Zahav had won the esteemed Israel Prize - regarded as the country's highest cultural honour. A newspaper published accusations of how since the 1980s, Zahav had been using his status and power to assault women and children. Meshi Zahav denied it and after police opened an investigation, he tried to kill himself, ending up in a coma.  . But the Meshi Zahav case hasn't been the only recent high-profile sex abuse scandal to have come to light among haredi Jews - who make up about 12% of Israel's population. Romi Schwartz, now 40, was sexually abused as a child and later raped by children's book author, therapist, and media personality Rabbi Chaim Walder to whom she had turned for help. \"He was like a mentor, a guru. The kids' whisperer,\" Romi says of Walder. His children's books were found in almost every ultra-Orthodox home. After her family arranged her marriage at the age of 17, Romi was still having panic attacks from her childhood trauma. Her husband tried to help by arranging therapy sessions with Walder. Romi says she felt reassured at first. \"He said I'm going to be there for you.\". But after a year, he took advantage of her trust and the fact she had led a sheltered life. He sexually assaulted her in his book storeroom and later tricked her into going to a hotel, where he raped her. Despite her ultra-Orthodox upbringing, Romi now considers herself a secular Jew. She says reporting such abuse to the police would be considered unthinkable by many in the haredi community. \"You don't go to the secular world's authorities, it's forbidden.\" . It was only late last year, after another newspaper investigation, that a special rabbinical court acted against Walder. The religious court found him guilty of sexually assaulting or raping more than 20 women and girls over decades. He protested his innocence, but as police began an investigation, he shot himself dead. It was the subsequent defensive reaction from some senior haredi Jews which drew a furious backlash from others in the community. Some rabbis and religious media reacted with silence or even by criticising the victims. They accused those who had spoken out against Walder of the sin of slander, even murder.  One abuse survivor then killed herself. If you have been affected by any of these issues in this story you can visit . BBC Action Line. . Religious activist, Shoshana Keats Jaskoll, says she and others couldn't believe that Walder was still being defended, and that it was his victims who were being blamed. . She said their reaction prompted an \"explosion\" of anger and \"an absolute revolution in the haredi community\". Avigayl Heilbronn, who describes herself as a modern haredi, is one of a growing number of women trying to raise awareness in a community which shuns the internet.  . She and others have been leafleting ultra-Orthodox households across Israel - more than a million flyers have been put through letterboxes. \"These are instructions for parents [on] how to talk to their children about sexual abuse,\" says Avigayl. \"We're not only making noise.\". The activists liken what is happening to the #MeToo movement. They say it has had a similar domino effect - \"with adults and children speaking out about historic and recent abuse by powerful figures - both men and women\". Questions remain, though, about how effectively the most conservative haredi authorities can act against sexual abusers. \"It is still a very long way to go,\" says Manny Waks - a former haredi Jew and founder of . Voicsa. , an organisation against child sex abuse in Jewish communities around the world. . \"Because a lot of it is the culture of how the haredi community thinks and no matter what you say or do, the rabbi is everything\". He speaks from bitter experience. He was raised in a tight-knit ultra-Orthodox community in Australia and he and his family paid a high price when he became one of the first to talk publicly about his experience of being sexually abused as a child. . \"The head rabbi from the pulpit said no-one has permission to go and speak,\" he tells me. \"My parents were ostracised, excommunicated.\". But Rabbi Aharon Boymel - who considered himself a friend of both Zahav and Walder - insists things are changing. . He says rabbinical leaders did not know about abuse by the two men but admits that a culture of shame and secrecy has been \"a big problem\".  . \"Once we used to brush this stuff under the carpet. Today there is no such thing. If someone abuses a young boy or girl, immediately we call the police,\" he says. But it appears not all is clear-cut. \"Today I know another story like that of Chaim Walder and Yehuda Meshi Zahav. Big names, important people, they've stopped [the abuse] and gone to get treatment thanks to this story,\" he says. Such comments have raised concerns among victims who believe some abusers are still being offered treatment rather than reported directly to the police. After more than a year in a coma, news broke in June that Yehuda Meshi Zahav - the man who had long tormented Shayli Tevel - had died. Days later, Shayli searches for his grave in the vast, centuries-old Jewish cemetery on the Mount of Olives. He finds it in a corner reserved for those who killed themselves - seen as a violation of Jewish beliefs. Shayli prays there alone for a short time. He leaves tearful but relieved.  . \"It's behind me,\" he says. \"It's painful, but now it's over.\". \"For everyone who's passed something like that, don't be afraid, whatever happened to you, whatever happened to your child, speak about it,\" he says.  . \"It heals you.\".", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-62984847", "related_stories": [], "related_topics": ["Sexual violence", "Israel"]},

Gunwant Grewal came over from Ludhiana, Punjab in 1965. Life wasn't what she had imagined. She had been a teacher in India, but could only find factory work when she arrived. . She lived in a room in Southall, west London, with her husband and daughter in a shared house, a far cry from her spacious home in India. She desperately missed her father who she wrote to regularly.  . \"My tears were on my letter as I was writing. My father said, 'Why was your letter damp?' and I said, 'Oh I was having a cup of tea,' when really it was tears. But slowly, slowly it got better.\" . One time walking past a bus stop, she saw an elderly Sikh man who reminded her of her father. She spontaneously hugged him. . A phone call to hear a loved one's voice was out of the question. Ravi Patel arrived in 1967 with \u00a31, having spent the rest on the journey over to Britain. He recalls that phoning India cost \u00a31.40 per minute, a vast sum then. So Ravi called his family in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, twice a year: once on Diwali and once on his father's birthday. . It remained that way until the early 2000s, when communications were revolutionised by companies like Lebara, which was started by three British-Sri Lankan entrepreneurs and offered cheap telephone calling cards. . You could now phone the Indian subcontinent for as cheaply as one penny a minute. Decades after Ravi left India, he could now speak to his best friend whenever he wanted. When I started interviewing these pioneers nearly a decade ago, their experiences were not widely documented, but in recent years there has been a growing interest in the stories of people who came from the former empire and made their once colonial ruler home. And the struggles of that generation for equality and against racism are now better known. Each generation has a different attachment to the place left and the place where they now live - but these private, and sometimes delicate, tussles between parents and children are rarely recorded. . I have been reporting on the ups and downs of . the relationship between Farah Sayeed and her mother Runi. , who came in 1968 as a young bride from Dhaka, East Pakistan, now Bangladesh. Farah was born a year later. Runi's generation often bore and raised their children alone, without the support of their own mothers or any wider family. For the next generation, it was different. . In late 2001, Farah was in Liverpool when she called her mother in London to tell her she was about to give birth. Runi says, \"I started to shiver and scream because I'm her mother and I should be near.\" She jumped into the car and drove to Liverpool. She arrived to be told her grandchild had been born. \"That was the happiest moment of my life,\" Runi smiles, \"I am eternal now.\". Waiting in the hospital corridor to see them jogged a memory. She remembered giving birth to Farah and writing a letter to her mother in then East Pakistan, saying she now realised what being a mum meant. . Runi recalled lying in the hospital bed with her newborn, in pain, and how she missed her mother who was so far away. She was hungry and wanted to be comforted by her mother's food. So when, decades later, she walked into Farah's room and met her grandson, she remembered that hunger and ache for her own mother. . She asked Farah what she wanted to eat. Chicken biryani, she replied. Runi searched Liverpool's halal shops and made that dish for her daughter. Three Pounds in My Pocket Series 5 starts on Friday 8 April at 11:00 BST on . BBC Radio 4. . You can hear the previous series . on BBC Sounds . Farah, after giving birth to her son, had her own revelation. \"Within seconds of becoming a mum, I had a completely different appreciation of what my mum must have gone through. She didn't have any real extended family around, compared to how supported I felt.\". Five years later, in 2006, Farah had another child and decided to return to London, to be near her mother. She had left the family home in 1988 wanting to get away from the burden of her parents' expectations, with a yearning to live her own life, her way. . In deciding to come back to be near her parents, she wanted to give her children something she never had - grandparents. Hers had lived in Bangladesh and she barely saw them. . Hearing Farah, I realised that there must be many thousands from the second generation, born in Britain, who grew up orphaned from their grandparents. This relationship between our children and their grandparents - the pioneers - has such a precious meaning for us, as it was something we never had. For Farah, life had come full circle. She wanted her children to be immersed in Bengali food, culture and language - things that were so much a part of her parents' home. It was the same home Farah had wanted to escape in the late 1980s. \"When you're young, you want to fit in, and when you're older, you're just confident - fitting in matters less than the things that made you who you are.\". Testimonies like these are an important part of the story of migration and the story of Britain. What began as an empire ended up with former subjects of the Raj settling as citizens, with generations now living here. Each individual making a choice about what to discard from the place left behind and what to hold on to in Britain. Runi's husband died last year. Her voice breaks as she tells me, \"It feels like you build a house and you start with one brick. I built the whole big house over the years with him. We fought, we argued. But we wanted to build that house, and we did.\". He is buried near their home in London. As a young man, he wanted to rest in Bangladesh's earth, in the family plot there. . But later, he realised his home was where his children and grandchildren were. His centre of gravity had shifted. . There had been many difficult and lonely times, but now three generations were successfully established in Britain. Runi tells me she has reserved a plot next to his. \"I feel that this is a big tree, solidly rooted into a land, and it cannot be pulled out.\".", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-60988410", "related_stories": ["'How I became a secret daytime DJ'"], "related_topics": ["Bangladesh", "London", "India", "British Asians", "Migration"]},

Her father Ian told North London Coroner's Court on Tuesday that his daughter had spent an increased amount of time alone in her room but still happily contributed to family life. . It was only after her death that he found she had opened a Twitter account without his knowledge. She used it to reach out to other accounts for help. After her death, Molly became a household name - a photo of her in school uniform appeared across newspaper front pages - as her father became a prominent campaigner for stronger regulation of social media. The BBC learnt about the account several years ago, and the Russell family hope publicising it now will help others. Ian believes most of Molly's time online was spent on Instagram and Pinterest, where she viewed thousands of images concerning suicide and self harm. . Representatives of both companies will give evidence at her inquest. Among other things, it will examine how social media algorithms recommend content and keep children online. . Molly spent much less time on Twitter - and the company is not involved in the inquest. . But nevertheless, the time she spent on the platform is significant - because we can see her own thoughts and feelings, written and composed as tweets, and how complex and nuanced a teenager's mental health can be. If you are suffering distress or despair, . details of help and support are available here. The Met Police forensically examined Molly's phone in preparation for the inquest. Officers handed over tens of thousands of pages of material to the Russell family's legal team, including details of the previously-unknown Twitter account. . The account revealed that for a year, Molly expressed her state of mind through a series of tweets and retweets. . The name she chose for her Twitter handle was \"Idfc_nomore,\" which Ian thinks meant, \"I don't care no more,\" with an expletive in the middle. . But normal teenage interests are reflected by what she wrote in her Twitter bio - a  short \"about me\" summary at the top of her account. It read: \"Harry Potter is life.\". Ian has locked the account so others cannot view Molly's tweets, but he is happy for us to quote them. She first tweeted in December 2016, sharing a post by an account dedicated to tweeting quotes about depression. That account has been on Twitter for years, with more than 200,000 followers. It appears to belong to an American teenage boy who has struggled with depression, self-harm and anxiety - a US suicide hotline number is \"pinned\" to the top of the account, so people will see it before starting to scroll down. Like many similar accounts, its bio contains the term, \"Trigger Warning - proceed with caution\". . When Molly followed this account, Twitter's algorithms would have recommended similar ones - the more you interact with content on a particular subject, the more of that kind of content is suggested to you. Twitter told us its number one priority was the safety of people who used its service. A spokesman said it has forged partnerships with UK mental health authorities to offer vulnerable people a support service called #ThereIsHelp, which provides mental health resources. . \"As a result of this partnership, when someone searches for terms associated with suicide or self harm, the top search result is a notification encouraging them to reach out for help,\" he added. The first picture Molly retweeted using her secret account was a hand-drawn image of a teenage girl staring at the night sky, saying, \"I'm ready to become one of the stars\". Teenagers may search for such content because they are feeling troubled and want to reach out to others. We are conscious of not wanting to direct vulnerable teenagers toward content of this kind, but they already follow these accounts in their tens of thousands - which Ian believes is incredibly dangerous. Ian says such images dress up suicide, and the grief it causes, in a way that makes it almost acceptable. \"There's a sort of stylistic, artistic, creative way that says, 'join this, join this club,'\" he says. The charity Papyrus specialises in suicide prevention for young people. It estimates four children aged five to 18 end their own lives in the UK each week. Calls to its helpline surged when Molly's story hit the headlines, with more than 30 families saying they felt social media had played a role in their child's death. . Its chief executive, Ged Flynn, says struggling with suicidal thoughts over a long period of time is not unusual. \"They will go over and over their thoughts, ruminate and cogitate sometimes for weeks and months,\" he says. \"Many young people do that online - exercising their uncertainty, trying to work it out, asking, 'Am I the only one to feel like this?' . \"People don't wear a big sign around their neck that they need help. They will drop hints and Molly was doing that online.\". Talking to your child about suicidal thoughts can be difficult and feel very daunting, . says the charity Papyrus. , but starting the conversation is the most important thing. It suggests these simple steps may help you discuss the issue with your child:. For months, if not years, it seemed Molly was able to hide her depression from those who knew her. . Ian remembers a time when she had not quite been herself. During a car journey he spoke to her about it and made her promise to tell him if there was ever something she needed to talk about. She agreed. . But Molly chose Twitter and Instagram instead. . She wrote on Twitter for the first time on 4 February 2017: \"I don't need to be saved, I need to be found.\" This came from a poem by the model and actress Cara Delevingne, about her own struggle with depression. A day later, Molly tweeted this, apparently a screenshot from her own Pinterest account: . \"It just shows the depth of despair she must have been feeling, which none of us had any idea,\" Ian says. \"I think she thought she was coping, she was finding a way through it. And then, slowly over those months, it all grew - and it swamped, consumed her. But she kept this secret.\" . In between her growing depression, Molly also shared the interests of an ordinary teenager on her Twitter account. She stayed up late waiting for a video to drop from US rapper Phora. She watched the American TV drama Riverdale. She retweeted Ariana Grande around the time of the Manchester terror attack. . But, at the same time, Molly sent a tweet to JK Rowling saying her mind was full of suicidal thoughts. She didn't get a reply, but that is not surprising given the author has 13.9 million followers and must receive countless mentions and messages. Some of Molly's activity suggests she was looking for help, but did not quite know where to find it. One of the stars of Riverdale, Lili Reinhart, has publicly struggled with depression. During mental health awareness month in 2017, Reinhart, who has more than three million followers, tweeted urging them to have strength. . \"When I'm feeling depressed or sad, I remind myself how far I've come,\" she wrote, \"and how I didn't let depression consume me.\" . Molly retweeted the posts but also messaged Reinhart directly, saying: \"I can't take it no more, I need someone but I can't reach out to anyone I love I just can't take it.\" . She did not receive a reply. Like JK Rowling, Reinhart has millions of followers and must equally be inundated with messages. . Molly would later tweet a link to an online TED talk from California Highway Patrol Officer, Kevin Briggs. In it, he shared his experiences of trying to talk to people in moments of personal crisis, when they were about to jump from bridges. It is clear from her tweets that Molly was struggling. She was depressed and, it seems, increasingly focused on taking her own life. On 19 July, she posted words of despair on Twitter: . But instead of talking to her family or friends, Molly discovered a Californian influencer who most people in the UK will probably never have heard of. . Salice Rose has a fanbase of millions on Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, and more recently TikTok. Molly messaged her repeatedly. Despite outwardly appearing confident and full of life, Rose has publicly struggled with her own depression and anxiety. . Was this what drew a teenager from Harrow, in north-west London, to her? . On her phone, it appears as though Molly had composed a note to the influencer thousands of miles away:. And Molly was clearly moved when Salice Rose posted a dramatic video advising how to overcome suicidal thoughts. . She repeatedly tweeted Rose asking for help, but did not receive a reply. . Ged Flynn from Papyrus says celebrities must be socially responsible. He says it is important to share and normalise the fact that life is difficult, but they must balance this by showing that help is available and where to get it.  . \"If I send you an email I may expect a response. For a young person like Molly, that expectation may be heightened. They've seen someone putting out their pain and they want to connect with that person,\" he says. . Molly's father Ian thinks his daughter believed Salice had been reading and answering messages more than  would have been physically possible. \"By being able to shout into the vast world of the internet, Molly had the false impression that she was being listened to when, in effect, she was just shouting into the wind,\" he says.  . Salice Rose sent a video statement to the BBC saying she was upset that she did not know who Molly was, because if she did she could have called her and told her not to end her life.  . \"It's a feeling of guilt, knowing that one of my followers ended their life because in that moment, I could have helped\u2026 and I'm trying my hardest not to cry, because this isn't about me, it's about Molly. It's super sad and she will always be in my prayers,\" she said. For Ian, Molly's tweets make hard reading. One showed his daughter was on her phone at 01:00, talking about drinking alcohol. He says Molly's entire family wishes every day that they had realised how she had been feeling and had done something different. . \"Part of learning to process the grief that comes with a death by suicide is also learning to deal with that guilt. Many nice people say you can't blame yourself but that's an impossibility. . \"Some days are worse than others. But I don't think there will be a day in the rest of my life where I won't blame myself.\". Looking at her tweets, it is clear that, at the end of September 2017, Molly's mood was darkening again. She messaged the US rapper Phora, who has 380,000 followers. Unfortunately, says Ged Flynn, Molly was looking for help in the wrong places. \"At its simplest, that a person is still alive and tweeting is an opportunity for someone to step in. We need young people to sometimes look for adult help, expert help and most importantly safe help.\". Ian agrees. \"If you're in a horrible low place where you actually want to end your life, please reach out to those people you love.\". To Molly's parents, everything appeared normal. They had no idea that anything was wrong. In the week before her death, Molly won a part in a school play and appeared to be looking forward to rehearsals. There was also a family celebration for her sisters' birthdays coming up. . On Monday 20 November, she completed her homework, packed her school bag and watched TV with her family. Ian remembers that  evening well - they were watching the new series of \"I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here\". Sitting next to him on the sofa, Molly was on Twitter on her phone. She wished Salice Rose a happy birthday - these are her last words on the platform: . Everything appeared normal. Yet, for a reason only she will ever know, Molly took her own life in the early hours of the following morning.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-62892636", "related_stories": [], "related_topics": ["Social media", "Suicide prevention", "Social media regulation debate", "Mental health"]},

Jane Corbin meets him at his base in Turkey. Night is falling as I make my way up the creaking stairs of a safe house in an anonymous alleyway in Istanbul, Turkey. I'm here to meet a kingpin in the people-smuggling trade - it has taken months to arrange, working through a trusted intermediary. It is the culmination of a BBC Panorama investigation into how thousands of migrants end up on the beaches of southern England claiming asylum.  . The people smuggler is from the Middle East - young and softly spoken, smartly dressed in black. He has agreed to tell me about his business if we do not reveal his identity. His bodyguards discreetly keep watch outside the house. . I challenge him that smuggling people is illegal: \"I know this is not legal,\" he says, \"but for me it's about humanity - that's worth more than the law. We help people, we treat them well, we respect women - we don't disrespect or hurt anyone.\". Nearly 2,000 people died in the Mediterranean Sea last year.  . In April, the UK government signed a \u00a3120m deal with Rwanda to send some migrants, mostly single men, to Africa to have their asylum claims processed. . The government said the aim was to smash the business model of the people smugglers and stop record numbers of people making the dangerous English Channel crossing. . Already this year, . more than 30,000  people have made the crossing in small boats, . about as many as the whole of last year. The people smuggler sends hundreds of migrants to the UK. He readily admits his trade is very profitable and says he runs it like a businessman. \"It doesn't matter if it's a whole family or an individual - each person pays the same price,\" he says. \"A trip to Britain will cost $17,000 [about \u00a315,000] in total.\". So how can he justify putting people's lives at risk in dangerous sea crossings in flimsy boats? . \"Accidents can happen. We try and scare people to dissuade them,\" he claims. \"I say to them, 'This road is dangerous and not worth it. You could die. And I tell his mum and his dad too.'\"  . He shows us a form - a disclaimer he says he gets customers to sign, acknowledging the risks. . Istanbul is the gateway between Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Europe - and this black market trade is booming here. Marketing is competitive. On social media, smugglers offer different rates depending on the destination. . There are fake passports and British driving licences for sale. Even sample questions from British Home Office officials to prepare migrants for a grilling. . The people smuggler collects his clients in safe houses in this sprawling city, which is home to about five million refugees. They are packed into small rooms, where they can wait months while their passage is arranged. His gang brings them food and water from local supermarkets. . \"We put them in a house and wait for everything to be prepared. And when it's ready we take their phones so the cops can't find out about us,\" the people smuggler explains. . Then the migrants are taken in a van at night from Istanbul to the mountains. They walk in groups of six or ten, down to the Mediterranean, to one of the people smuggler's boats. . They are bound for Greece or Italy. Channel Crisis: Can People Smugglers Be Stopped?. Jane Corbin investigates the smugglers who get people into Britain, and finds out what the government's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda means for those attempting the potentially deadly journey. Watch on BBC iPlayer (UK Only). The people smuggler denies it, but there have been allegations a migrant died on his boats. He shows us some videos - dozens of young men crammed on the decks of boats waving, shouting, thanking him. These are not just testimonials, they are proof they have made the crossing. . The money they have paid for the trip is held by middlemen and not released until the families can see they are safe. The smuggler even runs a luxury VIP service for clients who can pay more. . The migrants then make their way through Europe to the shores of northern France and, for some, their ultimate goal - crossing the English Channel to get to the UK. There's a network of criminal gangs along a 100km (60 mile) stretch around Calais, a franchise operation to help the people smuggler in Turkey get his clients across the final hurdle.  . \"We buy a small dinghy. It costs about $10,000-$20,000,\" the people smuggler says. \"One of the passengers gets a free trip in return for navigating the boat. They just go straight and when they get there, they just turn themselves over to the police,\" he says. He is anxious now to leave - his bodyguards fear they'll be discovered.  . The last time I saw the people smuggler in Istanbul he was buying another of these boats to make the crossing. His business, far from being smashed, is still going strong. Record numbers are still crossing the Channel, while the UK government has been back in the courts to argue that its Rwanda plan is safe and legal. A ruling on whether it can start deportations is expected next month. . Will the government's strategy make any difference? I asked him. . \"Even if they send 1,000 people a day to Rwanda, people won't stop, or change their decision,\" he said emphatically. \"If they are not afraid of death, they won't be afraid of going to Rwanda.\" . The government says the global migration crisis needs innovative solutions and that its world-leading Rwanda partnership will help fix the broken asylum system.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-62832633", "related_stories": [], "related_topics": ["Turkey", "UK immigration", "Immigration", "People smuggling", "Istanbul", "Migration"]},

Many have fled tensions with Chinese authorities there - others say they are attracted by a slower pace of life. The BBC has been speaking to some new arrivals about life in the UK. . Yowin Mo, Eddie Wong and their nine-year-old daughter Hayley swapped their high-rise flat in Hong Kong for a two-bed semi in Crewe, in the north-west of England. They didn't know anyone here and had never visited the UK before they moved, but so far they've had a good impression. \"Most British people are polite and laid-back,\" says Yowin.  . It wasn't an easy decision for the trio to leave their friends, family and jobs behind. \"My dad cried, he didn't want to leave,\" remembers Hayley. She wasn't sure about the move either, but getting a puppy helped her settle in. In Hong Kong, Yowin's marketing job was very demanding and she worked long hours. Eddie was a photojournalist. Now they've given up their hectic lives in a bustling world city to move to a small town with lower house prices and good schools. \"We don't expect to be rich,\" Yowin says. \"We are just hoping to have a simple life here, and hopefully Hayley can grow up happy.\". Yowin and Eddie felt leaving Hong Kong was in Hayley's best interests. She has happily settled into the local primary school, where 11 other Hong Kong children have since joined. . Yowin says going to school in Hong Kong was far more stressful - there was no playground to run around in and Hayley had homework to do until 19:00 every night. . But her main concern was that if her daughter had stayed in Hong Kong she would be \"brainwashed\". Yowin says Hong Kong's education system has . changed drastically.  because children are now being taught the Chinese state-approved curriculum. She also fears the phasing-out of the speaking of Cantonese in schools, and that Hayley would be taught in Mandarin Chinese. \"That's one of the reasons I don't want to stay in Hong Kong.\" . The Hong Kong government denies claims of brainwashing and says its education system has consistently developed generations of talents. It also says students are taught Cantonese, Chinese Mandarin, and English. Another of Yowin's concerns is censorship. She believes Hayley wouldn't get the \"true news\" on TV. \"Maybe only fake news, you know? In Hong Kong, she might not be able to say whatever she wants.\". On a high shelf, out of Hayley's reach, Yowin keeps a book of photographs of the 2019 protests called Defiance, including several showing violent clashes between protesters and police. When Hayley is a bit older, Yowin hopes the photos will help explain why they felt they had to leave. . \"When two million people are marching on the street and the government still ignores these voices, you will find the city is hopeless,\" says Yowin. \"Every time I talk about it, I cry.\" . They're far from alone in wanting to make the life-changing move. Government statistics suggest . 140,000 Hongkongers have applied to live in the UK.  under a new visa route. It was brought in last year in response to China imposing a . controversial new security law in Hong Kong. , which the UK said was an erosion of freedoms and rights. . The route allows millions of people from Hong Kong - who applied for a type of nationality called the . British National Overseas (BNO) citizenship.  before 1997, when the UK handed the former colony back to China - to apply to live, work and study in the UK. Family members can travel with them. After five years they can apply to stay permanently. The North of England is a popular destination, with many families settling in places like Crewe, Stoke, and Warrington. And businesses are springing up to service this flurry of migrants. . One recruitment company has taken on two Cantonese speakers to tap into the new labour force. \"We realised there was quite a big opportunity in terms of people coming over from Hong Kong,\" says Charlotte Shaw from KPI Recruiting in Stoke. . The agency hopes Hongkongers might offer a solution to the labour shortages, driven both by Covid and Brexit, says Charlotte. \"We found that a lot of Eastern Europeans decided to leave the UK and have gone back home.\" . They've already had thousands of messages from Hongkongers looking for work. . Britain's new Hongkongers. Since last year, thousands of people from Hong Kong have left everything they knew behind to start new lives in the UK. . Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only). Watch on YouTube (International). About 70% of those moving to the UK have a university degree or higher and more than half worked as professionals or senior managers in Hong Kong. So far, the recruiters have helped Hongkongers take up roles in call centres, food processing and office administration. . Eddie and Yowin know that they won't necessarily be able to earn the salaries they did back home, but they have a cushion of cash from the sale of their flat. . Yowin wants to work as a cashier or receptionist, whereas Eddie, who is taking English lessons, hopes to be a delivery driver. The recruiter offers them a 10-hour shift in a meat factory. \"It's going to be like working like a robot,\" says Yowin. Meanwhile, in Warrington, Matthew Tse has set up a property company to help Hongkongers buy homes. He says his team of Cantonese speakers is getting 20 to 30 new clients a day, and that on average each client is bringing \u00a3700,000 to the UK. Bidding wars have broken out, he says, with properties sometimes going \u00a330,000-\u00a340,000 above the asking price. One potential buyer, Charlie, is selling her apartment in Hong Kong for about \u00a3650,000 and has been on remote viewings of properties in Warrington, Cheshire, worth about \u00a3220,000. \"I've never been to Warrington before,\" she admits. \"But I've got a few friends there. I believe most of the houses in England will be big enough for my kids to run around.\". The growing interest in moving to the UK has fuelled an explosion of Hong Kong YouTubers documenting their new lives in Britain. Videos rack up thousands of hits and range from reviews of new housing developments to a guide to eating a full English breakfast. . Hongkonger Heidi Simpson, who lives in Nottingham, has become a full-time YouTuber since moving to the UK last year with her fiance, Chris. \"People in Hong Kong want to see videos of real life in the UK,\" Heidi says. \"Like how to rent a house or how to use the self-service checkout.\". Her videos are not political, but still they have become a target of those supportive of China's government. Heidi made a video about how difficult it was to make a GP appointment, but a pro-Beijing YouTube channel lifted parts of it as evidence that Hongkongers can't get medical treatment even if they have money. She feels her content has been used as propaganda to warn Hongkongers against moving to the UK. . \"I was so shocked. I'm not happy with it. But I don't know what to do,\" says Heidi. . She will continue posting, but has concerns about her videos being monitored, and doesn't talk about her family back in Hong Kong. The channel has not responded to the BBC's request for comment. . Many of those who took part in protests in Hong Kong have taken refuge in the UK. Nathan Law is one of Hong Kong's most high-profile pro-democracy campaigners. He's now in political exile in Britain as he says he would face imprisonment if he returned home. But even here, he is still a target of Chinese propaganda and online attacks. . \"You're facing the largest authoritarian regime in the world, their reach could be stretching in every corner of the society,\" he says. \"And they can mobilise the necessary resources to hurt you in many ways.\". Since arriving, one of the most serious threats Nathan has had was on a Chinese messaging service where users were offering a bounty of \u00a310,000 for details of where he lives in the UK. As a consequence, he is wary of being seen in public. \"I rarely talk to my neighbours. I rarely go to the pub, because you never know whether this information will fall into the wrong hands.\". But he refuses to let that stop him. \"I need to be brave enough to continue my work. If I stopped working, as someone who campaigned for Hong Kong's democracy, then that's a victory for the Chinese Communist Party.\" . But the BBC has found evidence that, occasionally, tensions from Hong Kong have surfaced in the UK. Some Hongkongers have told us how they have received abuse online, and in person, from those who support the government's policies in Hong Kong. . Alan, not his real name, says he was attacked on a night out last autumn by a group of Chinese men after he shouted a pro-Hong Kong slogan at them. . \"Around 10 guys chased me and one of them pushed me onto the ground,\" he says. He was kicked in his head and ribs. He showed us a picture of his face, covered in blood. The police arrested two people in connection with the incident, but the case has now been dropped. . \"I'm angry and scared because it is in the United Kingdom, not in China. How can I suffer this?\" he says. \"This is a country known for democracy and rule of law.\". In Liverpool, Christie has started teaching martial arts self-defence classes after hearing about similar incidents of violence involving Hongkongers and those who support the Chinese Communist Party. She shows the class how to block someone if they are attacked. \"We need to have some basic skills for Hongkongers to protect themselves when they encounter this kind of situation,\" she says. But for others, life in the UK is peaceful. . Yowin has been offered a trial shift at her local newsagent in Crewe, stacking shelves and learning how to use the cash register. \"As long as it can support my basic living, that's enough for me,\" she says. . And Heidi and Chris are preparing for their wedding. For their photo shoot they chose the most British of backgrounds, the Houses of Parliament. . Heidi is sad that their families won't be able to attend, but she plans to stay in the UK. \"We don't see a future in Hong Kong,\" she says.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-62658669", "related_stories": ["The UK Hongkongers living in the shadow of the handover", "What will the next 25 years hold for Hong Kong?", "How is Hong Kong run?", "What is the BNO visa for Hong Kongers?"], "related_topics": ["UK government", "Hong Kong anti-government protests", "Hong Kong national security law", "Hong Kong", "Hong Kong handover", "Migration"]},

She only released her first single three years ago, just after finishing her A-Levels. But now, Griff, real name Sarah Griffiths, is a BRIT Award-winning artist fresh off a set of international shows. It's been a hectic summer for the Black Hole singer, who has been touring with Dua Lipa, made her debut at Reading and Leeds Festivals and opened a gig with Coldplay at a sold-out Wembley Stadium. Not that long ago, Griff was studying for her A-Levels, but she kept her musical aspirations under wraps at school. \"I always just feel like there's like one kid in your year who's trying to promo their music and no one really rates them,\" she tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. \"I would rather keep it a secret. . \"And then if it does really well, then that's cool. And people can find out but I didn't want to be the one that spoke about it too much.\". Radio 1 at Reading and Leeds on BBC Sounds. Griff says she juggled her studies and love of music with an exhausting schedule of \"travelling into London, writing songs, coming back, doing essays [and] turning up to school really tired\". Despite realising where her real passion was, she vowed to stick it out at school, and ended up getting three As at A-Level. But she realised education wasn't for her. \"My teacher's like: 'Sarah, we haven't seen your personal statement',\" she says. \"I was like: 'Miss, please - I'm gonna take a gap year'.\". Griff spent about a year putting out music before the pandemic hit - but it didn't stop her finding success. . \"I kept releasing music and didn't know if anyone was listening and then I got a Brit Award, which is crazy,\" she says. Her packed touring schedule with Ed Sheeran will take her through until the end of the year, when she plans to take a break from the stage. \"I'm gonna need to take the time to write more music. So that's kind of like my, my downtime, but I'll still be working on writing,\" she says. \"This gap year has turned into a bit of a long-term job. So I don't think I'm going to uni anytime soon.\" .

Front line positions come under regular fire as both Russia and Ukraine attempt to push forward. The BBC's Abdujalil Abdurasulov gained rare access to the front line in Kherson, a region where Ukrainian men have been told they could be drafted to fight for the Russian army. An old Soviet self-propelled howitzer called Gvozdika or \"Carnation\" is rolled out in an open field and put into position. Its barrel tilts up. \"Fire!\" comes the command. The gunners hastily move away after the last shot, acting quickly. Although the advance of Ukrainian forces in the south is very slow, their artillery units remain busy. Stus, commander of the gunners, explains that the Russians target his infantry and they respond in order to silence them. Their job is very much felt at the front line. Soldiers walk across the vast field under the cover of a line of trees. They pay no attention to the sound of missiles flying above their head nor the thud of explosions. The fighters say a Russian observation post is 500m away and they might be within the range of small arms. . The Ukrainians move quickly to reach a destroyed farm building that they took back just a week ago. Now, they are digging trenches and carrying sandbags in order to fortify their new position. . But Ukraine's advancement in the south is moving slowly. . All talk about counter-offensive here helps to deceive Russians and achieve gains in the East, laughs Vasyl, a deputy commander of the regiment.   . \"But we have some success here as well.  We continue liberating villages with small steps but it's very difficult - every victory we have is covered with blood,\" he adds. . Many Ukrainians who remain behind the Russian front line, in the occupied territories, are anxiously waiting for this counter-offensive. . \"We're euphoric when Ukraine hits the occupied territories,\" says Iryna, a resident of Melitopol in the south. \"It means that Ukraine has not forgotten us. We all know that living near military infrastructure and buildings is not safe, so most civilians have moved out from those locations.\" . But for people in the occupied territories, the longer they wait, the harder it is to survive. Many believed that the counter-offensive would happen in August. But when that didn't happen, people started to flee towards Ukrainian controlled territories and areas further to the West. . Among them was Tatyana Kumok from Melitopol. The Israeli citizen was visiting her hometown when the Russian invasion started in February. She stayed in the city and distributed aid to residents but in September, she and her family decided to leave. One of the main reasons for leaving was Russia's promise to hold a so-called referendum. . \"As soon as it's done, the Russians will introduce new bans according to their laws and try to legitimise the occupation,\" she says. . With the city turned into a giant military base, she says it is clear that Russian troops won't abandon the city easily. . \"It was obvious the city won't be liberated this fall,\" she adds. . Even a silent resistance to Russian occupation is getting dangerous now. . In September many families were forced to send their children to Russian-administered schools even though their children would be exposed to the Kremlin's propaganda.  . \"If you don't send your child to school, it's a litmus test for you - it means you have pro-Ukrainian views,\" explains Ms Kumok. \"I know parents who had to tell their seven-year-old child not to talk about things discussed at home with anyone at school. Otherwise the child could be taken away. That was really awful.\". The crackdown on people who do not support Russian rule is rising. . \"There is a sharp increase of arrests since August following the successful Ukrainian air strikes,\" says Bohdan who is still living in Kherson. He spoke with the BBC via a messenger app and his real name is not being revealed for his safety.  . Bohdan says that earlier detentions were based on a list of names that the Russian military had. But now anyone can be arrested and thrown into a basement for interrogation. . Russian soldiers recently came to the house of Hanna (not her real name) in Nova-Kakhovka, a city in Kherson region, to check who was living there.  . \"They didn't go inside the house but it was still scary. I don't even walk with my phone now,\" she said via a messenger app. . The self-styled referendum is bringing a new threat to the local population - mobilisation. Many men could be drafted to fight for the Russian army. . Russian soldiers are already going house to house in some villages and writing down the names of male residents, local residents say. They claim soldiers have told them to be ready for a call-up after the referendum. . Men aged 18-35 are reportedly not allowed to leave the occupied territories any more.  . Iryna left on 23 September, the first day of the so-called referendum, with her husband and two children. They wanted to stay in order to look after her paralysed 92-year-old grandmother. . \"But when Putin announced the call-up, and we already knew about the referendum, it was clear there would be a mass mobilization and men would be detained right on the street irrespective of their age,\" she says.   . \"We could survive without gas and electricity, we could find solutions for that.  But not for this. That was our red line,\" says Iryna. . The Russian call-up will pose more challenges for the Ukrainian counter-offensive.  . It will certainly escalate the war and more people will die, Ukrainian soldiers say. . \"We shouldn't underestimate our enemy,\" says Stus, commander of the gunners. \"Those new recruited Russian soldiers will have guns and grenades, so they will pose a threat, which we will have to eliminate\". . As the gunners wait for new tasks with their howitzer hidden in the bushes, Russian troops hit a nearby Ukrainian village with Grad missiles. The gunners are silent as they listen to the series of explosions. . That terrifying sound was just another reminder that the success of the Ukrainian troops will depend on how quickly they can make Russian artillery and rocket launchers go silent. .", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-63049386", "related_stories": ["Inside Bakhmut, the city holding off Russian troops", "What Russia wants from the votes in occupied Ukraine", "Who is winning the war in Ukraine?"], "related_topics": ["Russia-Ukraine war", "Russia", "Ukraine"]},

The next day, you're not. . And that moment has arrived for Boris Johnson, who has made his . last speech.  as PM and departed 10 Downing Street for the final time. Liz Truss will be taking over and addressing the nation later outside the famous front door. . It can all change so quickly, but what happens when life suddenly stops as PM?. After his final speech, Boris Johnson is headed to Balmoral. To make his exit official, he still has to officially resign by meeting the Queen. Normally, this would take place at Buckingham Palace, but Her Majesty has suffered from mobility issues and it is understood the change was made to prevent the need for any last-minute rearrangements. If he's lucky, he will be given a personal gift by the Queen. Former PM Gordon Brown and his family got a signed photograph. What might Boris Johnson do immediately after that? He could look to a few former prime ministers for inspiration. . We know sleeping is an option - Gordon Brown revealed on David Tennant's podcast that \"you're very tired so you sleep for a bit\". Or he could choose to follow his passions - like former Prime Minister John Major did on the day he left office. . He . said.  it was \"time for lunch and some cricket\" as he headed to the Oval to watch Surrey. . Boris Johnson - who's displayed a fondness for tennis - could jet off to America to watch the US Open. Imagine losing your job AND your house on the same day. \"It's pretty dramatic,\" says Gordon Brown. \"In Britain, when you go, you not only lose the title, but you lose the house overnight and any ability to present yourself as something.\" . Boris Johnson will have spent just over three years living in Downing Street, welcoming the biggest politicians in the world, such as Donald Trump and Justin Trudeau. He's also had access to Chequers - a luxury country estate where a prime minister usually goes to chill out.  . These places will no longer be there for him to use, but house-hunting might not be an issue. He's thought to own several homes that he could be seeing more of soon. We all see the police officers who follow the prime minister around and provide security. But what happens after you give up the top job?. Previous prime ministers continue to receive security, so it's likely it will be the same with Boris Johnson. But that isn't always a good thing. Former Home Secretary . Lord Douglas Hurd.  says your security \"expects to know what you're going to be doing all of the time\".  . And let's not forget that, as prime minister, there is a big support system of secretaries, clerks and IT specialists who take care of everything when you are in the top job. However, they will be staying in Downing Street with the new PM - whoever that turns out to be. . That means Boris Johnson might just have to go back to doing everyday tasks such as calling people and writing letters himself. . Although if he stays on as an MP he will still have assistants to support him. You might remember that the prime minister has a nice official chauffeur-driven government car to take them around the country. . As all former prime ministers are also . entitled to one. , you'll probably continue to see Boris Johnson being driven around in a large Jaguar.  . But what about travelling around the world? . There's a massive RAF plane that takes the prime minister abroad to conduct important business, such as talks on the Russia-Ukraine war. . Unfortunately, he won't be able to continue using it so will have to take commercial flights like the rest of us or charter a private jet. Boris Johnson could continue serving as an MP, which is what Theresa May did, bringing him a salary of \u00a384,144 per year. . He could also write a book, something predecessors Tony Blair and Gordon Brown have done. Or, he might choose to leave politics all together and spend his time riding Boris bikes.

You open the app, take a picture of yourself and whatever's in front of you. . It could be the meal you've just cooked, the TV show you're watching, or your computer screen at work. . But as the app grows in popularity, do we need to be more careful what we post when we're on shift?. Or is zooming in on your friend's work computer just innocent fun?. The app was released in 2020, but started to get much more popular in mid-2022. Some reports say BeReal has had more than . 27 million downloads worldwide. . . If you're not familiar with it, it's a social media platform that notifies all users simultaneously at a random time every day. It gives you just two minutes to stop and take a picture of your surroundings. The idea is that it takes you off-guard, forcing you to be more \"real\" than you might be when curating, for example, an Instagram story. . Once you've posted, you can scroll through all of your friends' posts and see what they're up to. . Most users will admit they've enjoyed zooming in to their friends' screen to see the way they type on email, or what task they're up to. But talk has since turned to whether that's allowed - with people flagging data protection and privacy concerns. It's \"definitely a bad idea\" to take a BeReal of your work screen, says Emma Green, a data protection expert and managing partner at Cyber Data Law Solicitors. She says there are a number of factors to consider. \"Firstly, you will more than likely be breaking data protection laws if there's any personal data on those screens.\". That's any information linked to a person that makes them identifiable. So yes, even getting someone's email address in the shot would technically be a breach of the law. More importantly, Emma stresses that taking any photo of your workplace screen is very likely to be a breach of company rules. \"Probably in your employment contract, there will be a duty of confidentiality as an employee not to disclose confidential information about the company that may well be on those screens and even in the office in the background,\" she says. Even though you can choose who to be friends with on the BeReal app, Emma says once something is posted you can never be sure who will see it. Screenshots could be taken, or phones passed around among friends. . \"Especially if people are zooming in and reading emails, you may well be in breach of contract,\" she says. \"It could lead to disciplinaries, and so you could find yourself in a lot of trouble with your employer.\". You might be thinking this advice is dramatic, and be tempted to snap that photo next time your BeReal alert goes off. But Emma's key advice is that the post isn't worth the hassle it might cause. . Even if it's meant to be an innocent picture, shared among friends, if it ends up further than that you could be in trouble. . \"'I wasn't aware' or 'I didn't realise' is not a defence, unfortunately,\" Emma says.

Now her time on the show is over, she wants to use her on-screen fame to make a real-life impact for other deaf people. . \"I never had anyone to look up to that's like me on websites or TV,\" says Tasha - who finished fourth in the ITV competition this summer. Before the villa, the 24-year-old modelled - for websites such as ASOS - with her cochlear implant visible, yet she was a rare example. But according to Tasha, the depiction of the deaf community on TV is \"moving in a very positive direction\". \"I think representation is really coming a long way from where it was a couple of years ago,\" she tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. \"For example, Rose [Ayling-Ellis] on Strictly, and then I'm on Love Island,\" she says. Eastenders actress Rose, Strictly Come Dancing's first deaf contestant, won the show last year. . \"That's a massive thing for the deaf community, and in terms of representation, [it] doesn't happen enough in my opinion,\" says Tasha. But away from the screen, Tasha says there is still work to do - something she wants to help to address. \"A lot of people never know how to approach people that are deaf or hearing impaired because they don't know how to communicate,\" Tasha tells Newsbeat. . \"[You can be deaf-friendly] by learning basic British Sign Language, because if you just learn basic conversation, that really does go a long way.\". \"Always make sure your lips are based on them, because a lot of deaf [and] hearing-impaired people lip-read. Especially me, I'll always look for you 24/7. Another thing is don't cover your mouth!\". She also encourages others to \"be open and not to be judgmental\". \"Don't say comments like, 'I never knew you were deaf', or 'I couldn't tell because you're quiet'. I find it quite offensive.\". Tasha is encouraging others to learn BSL, and to become more deaf-friendly. . A month since the final, Tasha is still with her Love Island boyfriend, Andrew Le Page. But for fans to understand their latest announcement on social media, they'll have to know BSL, as they talk about their search for a house. . The islander says this is to highlight how deaf people can sometimes feel left out of conversations. . Tasha wears a cochlear implant, a small electronic device that electrically stimulates the nerve for hearing. While Tasha was on Love Island, her dad explained in a social media post how Tasha's cochlear implant can make day-to-day life more difficult. . \"Not many people are educated on how cochlear implants work and the side effects they come with, so it can be very draining for me,\" says Tasha. She says wearing the device can take a physical toll, with the magnet and coil inside the device sometimes giving her bad migraines. \"I'm socially active and I'm constantly having to lip-read. Being in group situations, I'm having to really focus on one person's voice, so I can miss out on many conversations.\". \"Even [on Love Island] when somebody said, 'I've got a text', and read out the message, the amount of times I missed out on what was said,\" she adds. . \"So it can really strain, there were days in the villa where I was absolutely drained and exhausted.\" . But Tasha tells Newsbeat that the response to her time on the show has been better than she expected. . \"It's honestly been so overwhelming, but in the most positive way, seeing all the beautiful messages from so many people in the deaf community. . \"I did not expect it at all.\".

How do you create a viral song on TikTok? Well, the person to ask would be 18-year-old rapper Stepz. The Londoner created one of the sounds of the summer with his second single . Cramp Dat,.  which samples Soulja Boy's 2007 hit Crank That. TikTok says the track dominated their weekly hot tracks chart, taking the number one spot for seven weeks. . And like most things on the platform, it's inspired thousands of people to take on a dance challenge - inspired by the song's lyric \"I got a cramp\". . \"I can't lie, Cramp Dat was just to get some more exposure out there,\" Stepz tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. . \"Cramp Dat is not even my favourite song out of my own. It was more a thing where I know that people will want to dance.\". Stepz's music might be racking up thousands of listens, but his relatable TikToks - think point of view videos and short comedy sketches - have also earned him more than two million followers on the app. \"I would use my comedy to promote my music as well. So most people think that I was a comedian before music, but the comedy was literally just to get my music more out there,\" he says. . And Stepz is glad he's also famous for his jokes. \"A lot of rappers in the UK are just talking about how many guys they've done this and that to, but I don't have to put an image on myself as if I'm someone that I'm not, because I do comedy,\" he adds. \"And people know that this is who I am. I can really just make music and talk about how I feel.\". He maintains that some negative stereotypes still surround rap.  . \"People think that all people in the UK talk about is stabbing this and stabbing that,\" he says. But people forget that rap is a talent. You don't have to be a bad youth to be able to rap.\". TikTok is influencing what we listen to more and more - but not everyone is a fan. Former Radio 1 Chart Show host Scott Mills recently told fellow DJ Greg James on his Unpopular Opinion slot that artists are making music with TikTok in mind. \"I feel this started around the time of the pandemic and the main culprit was Death Bed (Coffee for Your Head),\" Scott said. \"Then Jason Derulo got in on the act with that awful song Savage Love, and since then there's been hundreds. \"No disrespect to the artists but they're making them for TikTok.\". But according to a TikTok music boss, creating a hit just for the platform is notoriously difficult and people wouldn't succeed if they did that. \"I think if anyone is trying to write a song to be successful on TikTok today will probably fail because you can't make it happen,\" David Mogendorff, Head of UK Artist Partnerships, tells Newsbeat. \"You can't create that moment from nothing. . \"It has to be genuine artistry, genuine music and a genuine connection with the audience.\". The company also announced that . Sunroof.  by Nicky Youre & Dazy was its top UK track this summer. And TikTok says Kate Bush's Running Up That Hill - which felt inescapable after it . was used on the latest Stranger Things soundtrack.  - was also massive on the app, featuring in millions of videos. George Ezra also made his debut in TikTok's summer charts, thanks to videos of him performing Green Green Grass at Glastonbury. Follow Newsbeat on . Instagram. , . Facebook. , . Twitter.  and .

The musician, 30, was with his girlfriend when a gunman reportedly demanded jewellery before opening fire inside a waffle house in the south of the city. Police found PnB with multiple gunshot wounds and he was pronounced dead in hospital 45 minutes later. No arrests have yet been made over Monday's shooting. Los Angeles Police Department Capt Kelly Muniz said a suspect approached a couple inside Roscoe's House of Chicken and Waffles and demanded they hand over personal items. . She told reporters at the scene this led to \"some sort of verbal exchange\" before the victim was shot several times and fell to the floor. The suspect then \"removed items from the victim\", she said, before running to a waiting getaway car and fleeing the scene. US media has said law enforcement sources confirmed the rapper was the target of the attack. Tributes have since flooded in for PnB Rock - real name Rakim Hasheem Allen - who rose to fame with the release of his 2016 hit Selfish and had collaborated with artists including Ed Sheeran. Superstar Drake posted a photo of the pair together on his Instagram story, and rapper Offset posted a Twitter tribute urging followers to pray for PnB's two children. Others pointed out that the shooting follows the death of fellow rapper Pop Smoke - who was . killed in a Hollywood Hills burglary last February. . It's been suggested his killers were able to find his address after he accidentally revealed it in a social media post. The latest shooting has led to discussions about the safety of rappers, after it was suggested an Instagram photo of PnB and his partner may have revealed the pair's location. . DJ Akademiks, who runs a popular hip-hop YouTube channel, said he had interviewed the rapper just a week ago about a previous attempt to rob him. Nicki Minaj said Pop Smoke's death had taught rappers to be more cautious about their whereabouts. Meanwhile Cardi B took a different view, and challenged people who had blamed PnB Rock's girlfriend Stephanie Sibounheuang for posting the photo. She tweeted that it was \"highly unlikely\" that the suspects had tracked them online and that it was \"irresponsible and inconsiderate\" to blame Stephanie for \"something so tragic\". PnB Rock was born in Philadelphia in 1991, going on to record two studio albums, Catch These Vibes and Trapstar Turnt PopStar. He released his most recent song, Luv Me Again, just two days before the shooting. Follow Newsbeat on . Instagram. , . Facebook. , . Twitter.  and . YouTube. .

In June, . the singer revealed.  he was suffering from facial paralysis, after a diagnosis of Ramsay Hunt syndrome. The 28-year-old, who has been on his Justice world tour, now says recent shows have \"taken a real toll\" and he needs more time to \"rest and get better\". It comes a month after the singer announced his return to the stage. Posting on . his Instagram. , he says he had given \"everything I have\" following a recent show in Brazil. Ramsay Hunt syndrome.  is when a shingles outbreak affects the facial nerve near someone's ears, resulting in paralysis of parts of the face. \"After getting offstage, the exhaustion overtook me and I realised I need to make my health the priority right now,\" he says. \"So I'm going to take a break from touring right now. I'm going to be OK, but I need to take time to rest and get better.\". Ramsay Hunt Syndrome cannot be passed from one person to another, but it is a complication from a transmissible disease called shingles. Shingles is linked to the chickenpox virus that many people can get when they're children. According to the charity Facial Palsy UK, if the immune system becomes depressed and is less able to fight off infection, the body can become vulnerable to a reactivation of the chickenpox virus. It says stress is often a trigger as it can weaken the immune system, and people who are stressed are more likely to suffer from infections. Justin had earlier told fans he had been doing facial exercises to regain movement, but that it would still take time to recover. Back in June, the Canadian . posted a video.  describing how the condition has impacted him. \"It is from this virus that attacks the nerve in my ear and my facial nerves, and has caused my face to have paralysis,\" he said in the three-minute video. . He also smiled and blinked, showing his followers how the right side of his face did not move. Nicoya Rescorla, who has the same condition as Justin, told Newsbeat in June that it had \"taken away my independence\". . \"The pain has been horrendous - it's been debilitating,\" . she said. . The 28-year-old, from Marazion in Cornwall, got Ramsay Hunt in October 2020, and says it started with neck pain before the paralysis kicked in. Following that, she experienced a range of other symptoms too. \"The vertigo and balance has really knocked me sideways,\" she adds. \"It's isolated me really physically and mentally because I can't just go out if I want to - I'm having to rely on my husband and my mum,\" Nicoya said. But she believes Justin speaking out about the condition is important. . \"It's powerful for people like me and other people who are going through Ramsay Hunt syndrome.\". Follow Newsbeat on .

Her father was King George V's second son, so it was thought she would live the life of a very minor royal. But when her uncle unexpectedly quit the throne, he laid the path for her to become the longest-serving monarch in UK history. With no male siblings, the stage was set for Elizabeth to one day take the crown. Unlike most royal babies of the time Elizabeth wasn't born in a palace or a castle. She was born in a house in Mayfair, where there's now a Cantonese restaurant, and was nicknamed Lilibet. When she was born her parents were the Duke and Duchess of York but 10 years later they became king and queen. Grandpa England was what Elizabeth and her younger sister Margaret called their granddad, King George V. They first made appearances on the Buckingham Palace balcony with their grandparents. Even at a young age, she would greet the public with her famous royal wave. Elizabeth's dad unexpectedly became king when his brother gave up the throne to marry an American divorcee. It meant that she had to be home-schooled and taught subjects such as constitutional history. Even though she was a princess, she didn't have many friends her own age so a Girl Guides company was created at the palace. . During World War II Elizabeth made . her first public speech.  to the children of the Commonwealth. Elizabeth and her younger sister Margaret hoped to reach many children who were living away from home because of the war. \"When peace comes, remember it will be for us, the children of today, to make the world of tomorrow a better and happier place.\". Elizabeth joined the Women's Auxiliary Territorial Service during the war and was known as Second Subaltern Elizabeth Windsor. She trained as a driver and drove a military truck. The princess was sometimes referred to as No 230873 while she served. Elizabeth married Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten two years after the war. . The princess had to collect clothing ration coupons for her dress, like every other bride in Britain at the time. Unlike others, her wedding service was broadcast to 200 million people around the world. Prince Charles was born in 1948. Elizabeth and Philip went on to have three more children, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward. Their family would continue to grow, with eight grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren. Upon the death of her father in 1952, Elizabeth became Queen Elizabeth II. She was crowned a year later in Westminster Abbey and broadcast a speech to the Commonwealth. \"Throughout all my life and with all my heart I shall strive to be worthy of your trust,\" she said.

The 25-year-old explained that due to his twitches, people mistakenly think he takes drugs before concerts. TS is a condition that \"causes a person to make involuntary sounds and movements called tics\", . according to the NHS. . \"I have Tourette's, I've always had it, apparently,\" the Scottish singer said. He recently mentioned on stage that he has the condition, explaining why his shoulders sometimes twitch. . \"I do the shoulder twitch quite a lot. And you see underneath every TikTok and stuff, people are like, 'why is he twitching?', which is fine. Curiosity is fine.\". \"Do you think before performing [in front of] 20,000 people, as an anxious person, I'm going to take a big line of cocaine? Never going to happen.\" . Sources: . NHS . and . Tourette's Action. There has been a positive reaction to Lewis's honesty from fans with the condition. . \"It's good that someone of that calibre is able to feel comfortable enough to say, 'Yeah, I've got Tourette's syndrome',\" Holly Ann Maria tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. \"I think it's really important because it shows that yes, he has a debilitating disability. However, he is still very talented.\". The 23-year-old from Essex says Lewis's attitude is \"really quite refreshing\". \"A lot of people don't like to talk about controversial topics, but he literally talks about anything and everything and doesn't care.\". Lewis also spoke about how he has had Botox in his shoulder to try to limit the tics. . \"It's a new thing, I haven't really learned much about it - I'm learning. I had Botox on my shoulder to stop it moving. It worked for a bit.\". He told fans that he didn't think it was a big deal, but that when he got the diagnosis, it made sense to him. . Earlier this year, Billie Eilish spoke about having the condition, telling American host David Letterman that the condition can be \"exhausting\". . Follow Newsbeat on . Instagram. , . Facebook. , .

The British-born wrestler walked out to a standing ovation at Arthur Ashe Stadium in New York on Wednesday. All Elite Wrestling (AEW), which staged the Dynamite: Grand Slam event, officially welcomed her after the surprise appearance. Saraya announced she was leaving WWE in June after a long absence from the ring due to a neck injury. Her first appearance for AEW came after a four-way Women's World Championship match between Toni Storm, Dr. Britt Baker, DMD, Athena and Serena Deeb. Saraya, wearing a hot pink, studded leather jacket, emerged at the top of the walk-on ramp as a chorus of cheers rang out. After making her way into the ring, she pointed to the mat and yelled \"my house\" while glaring at the other wrestlers. It's not clear if Saraya, who last wrestled for the WWE in 2018, will perform in any AEW matches. But a tweet from company boss Tony Khan confirmed she had been added to its roster of stars. The reveal seems to have blindsided most fans, with one calling it a \"legit shock\", and many praising AEW for the \"huge signing\". Saraya, who was born in Norwich, is one of professional wrestling's best-known female talent. The 30-year-old held a number of major WWE titles during her career, and received awards recognising her contribution to its women's division. Saraya was played by Florence Pugh in Fighting With my Family, a 2019 film based on Saraya's early career and journey into the WWE. She is due to return to the UK when she makes an appearance in Norwich on 15 October. Follow Newsbeat on . Instagram. , . Facebook. , . Twitter.  and . YouTube. .

Canadian Police arrested seven people and estimated that thousands of dollars in damage was caused.

But \"destructive concert-goers became hostile\" after the cancellation was announced, according to Vancouver PC Tanya Visintin. In . a statement. , she said \"several hundred people began fighting and destroying property\". Bins and food kiosks were overturned and damaged, she said, and tables, fridges and tents knocked down and thrown. \"Several people climbed various fixtures including a tall lamp-post,\" she said. Bottles and other objects were thrown at police after dozens of officers were brought in from around the city to tackle the violence, PC Visintin added. No major injuries were reported. Lil Baby later apologised to fans for his absence, writing on Instagram: \"I would like to start off by saying I truly apologise Vancouver, Canada, the Breakout Festival, and to everyone who was in attendance! . \"I have been going so hard these past few months without any breaks that it finally caught up with me. And my body completely shut down. . \"I owe you guys big time and will for sure make up for it soon.\".  Lil Uzi Vert, Polo G and Sofaygo also pulled out of the festival. .

When she finally adopted one, he came with more of a royal connection than she realised. The 28-year-old welcomed Wilbur - \"the cutest puppy ever\" - last year. She was browsing social media one day when she stumbled across an article about the Queen's newest corgi, Muick. As she scrolled down, it dawned on her that Wilbur had come from the same breeder. \"I looked at the photo and thought 'Oh my God - the Queen has adopted his only brother',\" she tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. \"There were only two in the litter.\". After the Queen's death last week, people began to ask what would happen to her beloved corgis. It has since been announced that Muick, and the Queen's other corgi Sandy, will be going to live with her son Prince Andrew and his ex-wife. After Nadia found out about Wilbur's famous brother she felt she \"had to tell the Queen\" and decided to write to Buckingham Palace. She sent photos and copies his adoption documents to prove the canine siblings' connection, and to tell the Her Majesty she had been \"inspired by her and her love of the breed\". About 10 days later, Nadia says: \"We got a letter in the post with a royal stamp on it. \"The fact that we got a letter back as well - it's so cool. \"It said the Queen was delighted that we took the time to write to her, and she said it looks like Wilbur has an amazing home with us. \"So Wilbur lives in a small house and his brother's in a palace.\". Nadia says she'll be making the trip to London with Wilbur to pay their respects to the Queen this week. But she is just one of many young people who have decided to adopt a corgi in recent years. . Amy Powell - a 21-year-old student studying to be a paramedic - decided to get a corgi with her boyfriend, Sam, last year. . She also says the Queen was the main motivator behind her choice of breed. . \"When I was a bit younger, I always saw the Queen on TV with lots of corgis,\" she says. \"So I think a lot of it was growing up and seeing her with the dogs. After adopting her corgi - called Baxter - Amy says she was surprised to discover lots of people her age with corgis. . \"I think they're still thought of as an older person's dog,\" she says.  . In a Facebook post shared widely on a corgi-lovers' group last week, lots of owners around the UK said they believed their dogs had acted differently since news of the Queen's death broke. But, according to groups such as the RSPCA, it's probably more likely that the . dogs are recognising and reacting to their owner's emotions. . Amy and Nadia both agree they've noticed a change in their own pets' behaviour. \"Wilbur has been acting a little bit differently and has definitely needed a little bit more love over the last few days,\" Nadia says. . Amy says Baxter has \"never really been much of a lap dog\" but, after the announcement, \"he jumped up on our laps and wouldn't leave my side for the rest of the evening\". Follow Newsbeat on .

The addition, called TikTok Now, asks users to take a photo or video from their phone's front and back cameras at a random time of day. In a . blog post. , the company says this will allow users to \"share their most authentic moments\". But many have pointed out that it looks pretty similar to BeReal. That app, seen as an alternative to the filtered and curated feeds often associated with social media, has grown rapidly since it was launched by a small French company. It's currently third in Apple's overall UK App Store downloads chart, compared with TikTok's 13th place. But it has got some catching up to do, with some reports putting its total downloads at about 27 million against . TikTok's estimated three billion. . There are some subtle differences between TikTok's offering and BeReal's. Both will send users a notification at a random time of day, after which they'll have a limited time to snap a photo. TikTok Now also allows for 10-second videos. BeReal prompts you with the message \"It's time to BeReal\", whereas TikTok has settled on \"It's Time to Now\" for its daily countdown launch. As for sharing your posts, BeReal is restricted by design - photos are only meant to be seen by a small circle of close friends, in line with the app's low-key attitude. TikTok Now will offer users the ability to share their posts with the wider world, although it will be limited to friends by default. And younger users will have automatic restrictions placed on their posts. Following TikTok's announcement people were quick to point out that the concept behind TikTok Now looked very familiar. Others were more direct, accusing it of \"blatantly copying\" its smaller competitor. Tech experts leapt on the fact that Instagram had been beaten to the launch, after . the company confirmed last month.  that it was testing Candid Challenges, its own BeReal-style feature. And industry analyst Matt Navarra said the announcement by ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, was \"shameless and ferociously fast\". Could my BeReal get me sacked?. Instagram U-turns on TikTok-style revamp. TikTok reveals 2022 summer breakout artist. Social media companies have a track record of \"borrowing\" ideas from each other - with varying degrees of success. Some features we take for granted - Twitter's \"Like\" button, Instagram's Stories and the trend for short, vertical videos - have either inspired imitators or been copied from elsewhere. For example, Instagram recently rolled back an unpopular . TikTok-style revamp.  that filled people's feeds with videos. Even celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner weighed in, accusing the app of trying to imitate its rival and urging it to \"make Instagram Instagram again\". And you might remember Fleets - Twitter's ill-fated attempt to introduce disappearing tweets similar to Instagram's Stories features. Or you might not. . After a backlash. , the company quietly retired the feature after just a few months, saying it hadn't \"seen an increase in the number of new people joining the conversation with Fleets like we hoped\". As for TikTok Now, users in the USA will get it first, with the button for the feature replacing the current Friends tab. There are plans to release it as a separate app in some countries.

Once upon a time, it might have been surprising to see the West African genre's breakout star chatting to British pop royalty. But Eddie, who's been hosting the UK's first Official Afrobeats Chart Show for the past 12 months, isn't so shocked. \"It's a year that's been really significant for Afrobeats,\" he says. \"The growth, the sound that's penetrated around the world.\". The genre - a mix of African and Western influences - has seen a massive rise in popularity over recent years, with songs regularly crossing over into the mainstream. Burna Boy and Wizkid, two of Nigeria's biggest stars, have headlined some of the world's major music festivals and both took home Grammys in 2021. And some of the premier names in music, like Beyonce and Drake, have also featured Afrobeats artists on their albums. Burna Boy, who has dominated the Afrobeats chart since it launched, has been its poster child. His recent hit Last Last spent a whopping 13 consecutive weeks at number one - the longest time permitted before a track is retired from the top spot. He's also worked with top names including Ed Sheeran, Stormzy, Jorja Smith and rapper Dave. \"Everyone has seen Burna's rise transcend the west African Nigerian sound into the UK sound,\" says Eddie. \"And more importantly he's been able to just go around the world waving the flag of Afrobeats.\" . Last Last is among 11 tracks to have crossed over into the UK's Official Singles Chart Top 100 and Top 40, both peaking in the top 5. It was pipped to the overall top slot by Fireboy DML's Peru featuring Ed Sheeran, the best-performing track based on streams and sales in the UK. \"Whether it's new or established artists breaking new barriers around the world, selling out venues, stadiums, collaborating with other artists, it's just been beautiful to see the growth,\" says Eddie. \"Especially here in the UK where we have at least four Afrobeats songs in the official charts as well.\". Eddie is preparing to celebrate the Official Afrobeats Chart Show's one-year anniversary later on BBC Radio 1Xtra. And he's hoping year two is going to be even more exciting. \"For me the collaborations are going to get crazier and crazier,\" says Eddie, thinking back to Burna Boy's chat with Elton John. \"Wouldn't we want to see that sort of collaboration as well?. \"I see it getting wider and wider and a new generation taking on to it. \"I've always felt the music was going to get here - it's been about people having the privilege of being able to catch up with this music.\".

The Canadian actor has been open about his desire for the adamantium-clawed anti-hero to join his foul-mouthed mercenary on-screen. Previous films have made references to Wolverine - with Jackman making a post-credit cameo in Deadpool 2. And Reynolds finally confirmed what fans had hoped in a 90-second reveal.  . The video has had more than 25 million views, been liked one million times and has received hundreds of thousands of replies - many excited about the news - in less than a day. He tweeted the announcement with the caption \"Hard keeping my mouth sewn shut about this one\" - a reference to Deadpool's previous appearance in 2009's X-Men Origins: Wolverine. In the video, he sits on a sofa and talks about his desire to make Deadpool's first official appearance in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) \"feel special\". He narrates about his search for inspiration over the top of a montage of him performing various tasks. . These include walking through the woods, and, in a cheeky nod to the football team he co-owns - working out while sporting a Wrexham AFC baseball cap. The clip then cuts back to Reynolds on the sofa, as Jackman walks through the background of the shot. \"Hey, Hugh,\" says Reynolds, \"want to play Wolverine one more time?\". \"Yeah, sure, Ryan,\" Jackman replies. The video then cuts to a title card - \"Coming Hughn\" - before a Deadpool logo fades in and Wolverine's famous claw marks appear over the top of it. Reynolds later posted a second video - this time joined by Jackman on the same sofa - promising to answer a string of questions from fans. However, in true Deadpool style, most of the dialogue in the pair's slightly sweary, . tongue-in-cheek response.  is drowned out by a jaunty 80s pop hit. Jackman first played Wolverine - a mutant with regenerative powers - in 2000's X-Men, and appeared in multiple films as the character. His last appearance, in 2017's Logan - was assumed to be . his final outing in the role. . Follow Newsbeat on . Instagram. , . Facebook. , . Twitter.  and . YouTube. .

After three years without a solo release - Stormzy dropped his new single Mel Made me Do It with a powerful, 10-minute music video on Thursday night. It stars a range of black British icons, from Dave to Little Simz, as well Brenda Edwards, mother of late music producer Jamal. Cameos from sport, musical and cultural heroes have been called \"a celebration of Black British excellence\". The track has been an instant hit - racking up more than one million Youtube views in less than 24 hours. And many black British people have been heaping praise upon Stormzy's latest. Afolabi spoke to BBC Newsbeat about his own reaction.  \"I still struggle to call myself a black Brit. I grew up here all my life and I have strong ties here, but I'm also Nigerian\" says Afolabi. \"There are times when this country will remind you that we're not wanted and it makes me glad that I'm Nigerian because I have a community that I can still relate to,\" says the 29-year-old. \"However, Stormzy's video really made me proud to call myself a black Brit.\". Afolabi was particularly excited to see all the stars in the video - from talk show hosts to . football managers. . \"Take Ian Wright as an example,\" he says. . \"He's a legend that faced adversity and got into professional football at a late age and still succeeded.\". Afolabi also names Jenny Francis - who \"provided joy for so many of us\" - and Noughts and Crosses author Malorie Blackman as personally significant appearances. In the music video Malorie walks alongside another author, Jade LB, who wrote the award winning book - Keisha the Sket. Jade told . Newsbeat last year.  that she's an \"advocate\" for telling stories from \"marginalised communities\". \"These people and so many more played a part in shaping me and our struggles and our joy are similar in one way or another and that for me is what truly makes us black British,\" says Afolabi. The track is named after Melissa Holdbrook-Akposoe, better know as influencer Melissa's Wardrobe - Stormzy's stylist and CEO of It's a Lifestyle Hun. Her impact has been highlighted on social media as well. \"Understanding Melissa's influence is not a surprise to me. I'm an invested fan so I was aware for a long time and has been aware of her affiliation with Big Mike,\" says Afolabi. \"When Stormzy was on Instagram, she was always on the stories and look at the amazing job she did for him at The Met Gala. The core of us have known of Melissa and her influence for a long time, the mainstream are just catching up.\".
